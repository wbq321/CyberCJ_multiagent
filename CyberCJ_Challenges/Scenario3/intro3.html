                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The ability to monitor and detect anomalous activity within a system is critical for an organization, an information security team, and law enforcement.  It is the first step in identifying activity that needs to be responded to by an organization and possibly escalated to law enforcement.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    The challenge to an organization is multifaceted.  An organization’s systems can and will generate a lot of data.  This data needs to be reviewed and analyzed for patterns that would denote an issue that needs to be investigated.  This poses two challenges.  The first is the volume of data.  The second is how to process and analyze this data.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    Developers can develop queries and use analytics software to help reduce the overhead of these tasks.  This approach is limited by the expertise of the developer and experience with behavioral activity that might denote maliciousness.  Law enforcement is a tremendous resource that has experience in analyzing and recognizing activity that is suspicious and should be investigated.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    This is where AI comes into play.  It provides an opportunity for law enforcement to put their expertise into use by analyzing data and recognizing patterns.  It provides an easy-to-use interface that can be interacted without knowledge of a programming language or software development skills.  AI empowers a law enforcement individual to upload data from a spreadsheet (or larger database) and provide guidance on what to look for.  Depending on the amount of data, the AI engine can identify patterns and provide insightful analysis.
