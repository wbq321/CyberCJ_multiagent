                                    Segregation of duties (SOD) is an important concept in cybersecurity. It establishes boundaries and perimeters that limit access based on need-to-know and least privilege. This helps protect an organization from accidental or malicious acts, functioning like an invisible fence inside the organization that prevents individuals from having too much access.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    SOD is important to law enforcement as it relates to opportunity. It assists in identifying individuals who may have the means to act without mitigation or oversight controls. Conversely, it protects an organization from these same acts by forcing collusion for unauthorized actions to occur.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    AI can assist an organization in several ways. It can help develop SOD policies and processes and also aid in implementing these processes to ensure adherence and identification of possible gaps. Lastly, AI helps monitor SOD configurations and audit logs to identify actions that violate SOD policies and procedures.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    An example of how AI aids in reducing the risk of excessive access is the concept of access creep. An organization operates as a dynamic system, constantly changing day by day. Changes in an individual’s roles and responsibilities may lead to changes in their level of access. If their access isn't adjusted when their role changes or during periodic reviews, they can retain legacy access from their previous role, leading to access creep.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    The test database designed for this scenario examines access creep. An individual recently elevated to a supervisor role gains oversight responsibilities with approval access. However, their access for creation, modification, and deletion must be removed. In Laura Anderson's case, her ability to modify transactions has been maintained.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    This is where AI becomes helpful in identifying users with access that violates SOD policies. It can analyze the organization’s access control list, identify violations for remediation, and highlight areas that may require additional investigation if unauthorized actions have been taking place.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
