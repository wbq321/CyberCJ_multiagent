                                <h2>Hotel CEO Finds Unwelcome Guests in Email Account:</h2>
                                <h3>Scenario: </h3>
                                <p >
                                    The CEO of a boutique hotel realized their business had become the victim of wire fraud when the bookkeeper began to receive insufficient fund notifications for regularly recurring bills. 
                                    A review of the accounting records exposed a serious problem. 
                                    At some point a few weeks before, the CEO had clicked on a link in an email that they thought was from the IRS. 
                                    It wasn&apos;t. When they clicked the link and entered their credentials, the cyber criminals captured the CEO&apos;s login information, giving them full access to intimate business and personal details.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Attack:</h3>
                                <p >
                                    <b>Social engineering, phishing attack.</b><br>
                                    <em style="font-size: .8em;">
                                        A phishing attack is a form of social engineering by which cyber criminals attempt to trick individuals by creating and sending fake emails that appear to be from an authentic source, such as a business or colleague. 
                                        The email might ask you to confirm personal account information such as a password or prompt you to open a malicious attachment that infects your computer with malware.
                                    </em>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Response:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The hotel&apos;s cash reserves were depleted. 
                                    The fraudulent transfers amounted to more than $1 million. 
                                    The hotel also contacted a cybersecurity firm to help them mitigate the risk of a repeat attack.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Impact:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The business lost $1 million to an account in China. 
                                    The funds were not recovered.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                                <ol>
