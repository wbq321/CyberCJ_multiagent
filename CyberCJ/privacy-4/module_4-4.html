                        <p>Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                            This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                            and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions.
