                        <h3>4.1: Introduction to Privacy</h3>
                        <p>This section emphasizes the importance of being aware of cybersecurity threats in our daily lives. Not all threats are direct or overt; some come from subtle and subversive actors, including surveillance-based advertisers, governments, data miners, and even educational institutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>Computer privacy in the context of criminal justice studies refers to the protection of sensitive information in digital form, particularly as it relates to the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of those in the criminal justice field, including law enforcement, legal professionals, and correctional authorities. For criminal justice students, understanding computer privacy is critical for several reasons.</p>

                                        <b>Legal Requirements:</b> <br>
                                        Students must learn about the legal protections around digital data, such as laws against unauthorized access and misuse of computer systems, including the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

                                        Ethical use of information technology in criminal justice involves respecting the privacy rights of individuals while balancing public safety needs. This includes the ethical handling of data obtained from computer systems, surveillance technology, and personal digital devices.

                                        <b>Investigative Techniques: </b><br>
                                        Students need to understand how to legally and ethically collect, analyze, and store digital evidence for use in criminal investigations and prosecutions. This includes knowledge of digital forensics and the legal standards required to present digital evidence in court.

                                        Students must be familiar with privacy policies that govern the use of technology in criminal justice settings. This includes understanding how data can be shared between agencies and with the public, and the implications of data breaches or misuse.

                                        <b>Technological Impact:</b><br>
                                        As technology evolves, so do the privacy concerns related to its use in criminal justice. Students must stay informed about current and emerging technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence, and their implications for privacy and civil liberties.
