                                    web servers is paramount. From the smartphones we carry in our pockets to the servers hosting our favorite websites, 
                                    understanding the threats they face is essential for safeguarding our digital lives.

                                        <b>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: </b> <br>
                                        DDoS attacks overwhelm a target system, network, or service with a flood of traffic from multiple sources, 
                                        rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. These attacks can disrupt operations, cause financial losses, and damage reputation.

                                        <b>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): </b><br>
                                        APTs are sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks typically carried out by nation-state actors, organized cybercriminal groups, or 
                                        well-funded adversaries. APTs involve a prolonged and stealthy infiltration of a target's network to steal sensitive information, 
                                        disrupt operations, or cause damage over an extended period.

                                        <b>Zero-Day Exploits: </b><br>
                                        Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor or have not been patched yet. 
                                        Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems, install malware, or steal data before security patches are released.

                                        <b>Ransomware Attacks:  </b><br>
                                        Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files or locks them out of their systems until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks can 
                                        cause widespread disruption, financial losses, and data breaches, making them particularly damaging to businesses, organizations, and individuals.

                                        <b>Supply Chain Attacks: </b><br>
                                        Supply chain attacks target vulnerabilities in the software, hardware, or services provided by third-party vendors or suppliers. Attackers exploit 
                                        these vulnerabilities to infiltrate a target organization's network, steal data, or launch further attacks, often with far-reaching

                                        <b>Cyber Espionage:  </b><br>
                                        Cyber espionage involves the unauthorized acquisition of sensitive information or intellectual property for espionage purposes. 
                                        Nation-state actors, cybercriminal groups, or competitors may conduct cyber espionage to gain strategic, economic, or military advantages.

                                        Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smart cameras, thermostats, and industrial sensors, are increasingly targeted in cyberattacks. 
                                        Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices to gain access to networks, launch DDoS attacks, or compromise critical infrastructure systems.

                                        Social engineering attacks manipulate human psychology to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information, performing actions, or 
                                        compromising security. Techniques such as phishing, pretexting, baiting, and tailgating are commonly used in social engineering attacks.
