                                <p>Picture the internet as an ocean, its surface shimmering with familiar websites and services. 
                                    But beneath lies a hidden world – the deep and dark web – where internet security takes on a whole new meaning.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Surface Web:</b> <br>
                                        The world wide web or surface web is the part of the internet that is easily accessible and searchable through standard search engines 
                                        like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. It's the web that most people interact with on a daily basis. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The surface web itself is not vulnerable, but the vulnerability of individual websites or online platforms depends on certain factors, 
                                        including their security measures, updates, and how well they protect against potential threats. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        On the defensive side, cybersecurity pros use tools to check the WWW for signs of trouble, like leaked passwords or discussions about 
                                        cyber attacks. This helps them track down and be on top of problems before they become serious.
                                        <br>
                                        Attackers also use the WWW to share hacking tools, plan attacks, and exchange information. This means security teams must always be 
                                        alert and ready to adapt to new methods coming from attackers.<br>

                                        <b>The Deep Web: </b><br>
                                        The deep web refers to the portion of the internet that isn't indexed by traditional search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. 
                                        It's comprised of websites that are not accessible through standard web browsers and often require specific software, configurations, 
                                        or permissions to access. This part of the internet includes paywalls, databases, password-protected sites, and other content that isn't meant for 
                                        public consumption. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Now, the deep web itself isn't inherently criminal. It includes things like academic databases, private company intranets, and other 
                                        legitimate platforms that aren't designed to be indexed by search engines. However, it also harbors elements of the internet that are 
                                        used for illegal activities, which is where the term "dark web" often comes into play. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In terms of criminal justice, the deep web is pertinent for a few reasons:
                                        <br>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Hidden Information: <br> Criminals may use the deep web to hide information, such as their identities, communication, and 
                                                illicit transactions. This hidden nature poses challenges for law enforcement agencies trying to track criminal activities 
                                                and gather evidence.
                                            </li>
                                            
                                            <li>Investigative Leads: <br> Despite being hidden, the deep web can provide valuable leads for criminal investigations. Law 
                                                enforcement agencies can use specialized tools and techniques to access certain parts of the deep web, uncovering information 
                                                crucial to solving cases. 
                                            </li>

                                            <li>Cybercrime Infrastructure: <br> Elements of cybercrime, such as botnets, malware distribution networks, and hacking forums, may operate 
                                                within the deep web. Understanding and infiltrating these networks are essential for combating cyber threats and safeguarding digital infrastructure.

                                        <b>The Dark Web:</b><br>
                                        The dark web is a hidden portion of the internet that requires specific software, configurations, or permissions to access. Unlike the deep web, which 
                                        includes all unindexed content, the dark web specifically refers to websites and content that exist on overlay networks and can only be accessed with 
                                        specialized tools like Tor (The Onion Router) browser.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Renowned for its notorious mask of anonymity, the Dark Web emerges as a focal point for underground transactions and illicit activities making it a hub of 
                                        criminal commerce. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The inception of the Dark Web can be traced back to the strategic endeavors of the United States (US) Department of Defense, which 
                                        sought to establish a secret and secure communication channel for its intelligence operatives.
