                                <p>Computer security is necessary to protect computer systems and their data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. <br>
                                    Key benefits include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Protecting Sensitive Data:</b><br>
                                        Criminal justice systems handle highly sensitive data such as personal information, investigation details, and national security data. 
                                        Effective protection is vital to prevent identity theft, compromised investigations, or data misuse.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Maintaining Public Trust:</b><br>
                                        Trust in the criminal justice system hinges on protecting sensitive data. 
                                        Strong security measures ensure public confidence.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Enhancing Investigative Capabilities:</b><br>
                                        Understanding cybersecurity helps during the investigation of cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking, leading to more effective prevention and prosecution.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Compliance with Legal Standards:</b><br>
                                        Agencies must comply with data protection and privacy regulations. 
                                        Failure to do so leads to legal issues and reputational damage.
                                    </li>

                                <h3>Internet Security</h3>
                                <p>Internet security is critical for criminal justice professionals due to the high risk of cybercriminals exploiting online vulnerabilities. <br>
                                    Key considerations include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Network Shared Directories:</b><br>
                                            Shared directories are commonly used within criminal justice systems. 
                                            Unauthorized access can compromise investigations and sensitive data.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Cloud Storage:</b><br>
                                            Cloud storage makes data easily accessible but also vulnerable. 
                                            Any data stored there could be compromised, leading to significant breaches.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>Privacy</h3>
                                    <p>Criminal justice professionals must ensure that privacy and data management practices safeguard sensitive information.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Backup Strategies:</b><br>
                                            Effective backups provide an essential safety net for restoring sensitive data after breaches. 
                                            If compromised data can't be restored, investigations could be at risk.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Disconnect and Isolate Devices:</b><br>
                                            Isolating devices is critical for ensuring that sensitive data remains private. 
                                            Without physical disconnection, attackers could access data indirectly via connected storage.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                                    Despite being the primary means of authentication for personal security, passwords are not strong defenses against attackers. 
                                    Users frequently choose weak passwords and use the same password multiple times. 
                                    With the help of AI, it is easier than ever before to crack poor passwords.
