                                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40%;"><b>Viruses:</b>  </br>
                                    A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40%;"><b>Worms:</b> </br>
                                    Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40%;"><b>Bots:</b> </br>
                                    Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources.
                                </p>
