                                    Monitoring and managing firewalls is a vital component of a proper cybersecurity posture, 
                                    particularly for safeguarding the networks and computers used in sensitive sectors like criminal justice. 
                                    Firewalls act as the first line of defense, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
                                    This includes not only blocking unauthorized access but also managing data packets that might carry potential threats. 
                                    Effective firewall management involves regular updates and audits to ensure that all security protocols are up to date and functioning as intended.

                                <h3>Personal Firewalls</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Function:</b><br>
                                        Personal firewalls act as packet filters that control the traffic entering or exiting a personal computer.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Application Firewalls: These </b><br>
                                        These are typically pre-installed on modern operating systems and are designed to allow traffic through only for specific, approved programs. 
                                        This helps to prevent an infected computer from spreading malware to other machines.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Traffic Control: </b><br>
                                        By default, these firewalls block all inbound traffic unless it has been explicitly allowed, while generally permitting outbound traffic unless specifically blocked.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Network Firewalls</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Hardware-Based: </b><br>
                                        Network firewalls are usually hardware devices placed at the edge of a network.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Scope: </b><br>
                                        They are designed to protect the entire network by inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic to decide whether to deny or allow it.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Location: </b><br>
                                        Often integrated into the routers provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), they serve as the first line of defense for all devices connected to the network.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Best Practices for Firewall Management</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Regular Inspections:</b><br>
                                        Periodically check firewalls to ensure they are active and functioning as expected. 
                                        This includes verifying that no unauthorized changes have been made to the rules—a common target for malware designed to weaken network defenses.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Dual Use: </b><br>
                                        For enhanced security, it is best to use both application and network firewalls. 
                                        This layered approach helps to secure individual machines as well as the entire network, contributing to a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity.
