                                <h2>A Construction Company Gets Hammered by A Keylogger:</h2>
                                <h3>Scenario: </h3>
                                <p >
                                    A small family-owned construction company made extensive use of online banking and automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. 
                                    Employees logged in with both a company and user-specific ID and password. Two challenge questions had to be answered for transactions over $1,000.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The owner was notified that an ACH transfer of $10,000 was initiated by an unknown source. 
                                    They contacted the bank and identified that in just one week cyber criminals had made six transfers from the company bank accounts, totaling $550,000. 
                                    How? One of their employees had opened an email from what they thought was a materials supplier but was instead a malicious email laced with malware from an imposter account.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Attack:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Cyber criminals were able to install malware onto the company&apos;s computers, using a keylogger to capture the banking credentials.</b>
                                    <br>
                                    <em style="font-size: .8em;">
                                        A keylogger is software that silently monitors computer keystrokes and sends the information to a cyber criminal. 
                                        They can then access banking and other financial services online, using valid account numbers and passwords.
                                    </em>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Response:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The bank was able to retrieve only $200,000 of the stolen money in the first weeks, leaving a loss of $350,000. 
                                    The bank even drew over $220,000 on the business&apos; line of credit to cover the fraudulent transfers. 
                                    Not having a cybersecurity plan in place delayed the company response to the fraud.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The company also sought a cybersecurity forensics firm to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Help them complete a full cybersecurity review of their systems.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Identify what the source of the incident was.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Recommend upgrades to their security software.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Impact</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The company shut down their bank account and pursued legal action to recover its losses. 
                                    The business recovered the remaining $350,000 with interest. No money for time and legal fees was recovered.
                                </p>
