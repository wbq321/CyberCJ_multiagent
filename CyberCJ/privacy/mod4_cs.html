                                <p><b>Background </b></p>
                                <p>The case of Carpenter v. United States (2018) set a significant precedent in the realm of digital privacy and Fourth Amendment protections. The Supreme Court ruled that the government must obtain a warrant before accessing an individual's cellphone location data, marking a pivotal shift in privacy law as it applies to the digital age.</p>   
                                <p><b>Scenario</b></p>
                                <p>In 2011, Timothy Carpenter was implicated in a series of armed robberies. To build their case, the FBI obtained Carpenter's cellphone location data from his wireless carriers without a warrant. This data included 127 days' worth of Carpenter's movements, which the FBI used to place him near the crime scenes. Carpenter argued that this was a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
                                <p><b>Supreme Court Ruling</b></p>
                                <p>In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Carpenter, stating that accessing historical cellphone location data without a warrant constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court recognized the sensitivity and extensive nature of location data, which can reveal a detailed and intimate portrait of a person's life, including their movements and associations over time. </p>

                                       <p><b>Expectation of Privacy:</b> The Court emphasized that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their physical movements and that this expectation is not nullified by the fact that the data is held by a third party (the cellphone company).</p>
