Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1 What is Malware? Malware is software that enters your computer system, without your knowledge, and carries out unwanted actions.
                                    Often, these actions damage, disrupt, or steal data on your computer; but they can even include planting a foothold for future access to your computer.
                                    If we think of your computer as a fortress, holding and protecting all of your valuable goods and information, then we can view malware as any type of non-human invader 
                                    that is trying to control access to those valuables. As there are many types of malware, it can be difficult to categorize them. 
                                    So, a common practice is to categorize them based on their primary action. These primary actions are: Kidnap Data Eavesdrop Masquerade Serve as Launchpad Sidestep External Resource Link: Cybersecurity & infrastructure Security Agency Malware Tip Card Malware Primary Actions Kidnap Data: This type of malware specifically targets and restricts access to critical data, systems, or devices. 
                                    The predominant form, ransomware, encrypts essential files and systems, demanding payment for decryption keys. 
                                    Such attacks can cripple the operational capabilities of law enforcement departments, courts, corrections facilities, and legal firms, 
                                    resulting in substantial operational disruptions and significant financial losses. Eavesdrop: Eavesdropping malware captures and transmits user data without consent. 
                                    Examples include keyloggers that record keystrokes, spyware that monitors user activities, and other software that can access device cameras and microphones. 
                                    These tools are used for stealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and personal identification information. Masquerade: This category includes malware that impersonates legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it under false pretenses. 
                                    Once operational, it executes malicious activities that can compromise legal investigations and sensitive data. 
                                    Specifically, criminal justice professionals should be wary of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Trojans. 
                                    These often come bundled with legitimate software or misrepresent their functionality, posing significant risks to the integrity of criminal justice systems and operations. Serve as Launchpad: Launchpad malware hijacks infected devices to initiate additional cyberattacks. 
                                    This includes viruses and worms that autonomously replicate and circulate across multiple systems, as well as bots that integrate into botnets. 
                                    These botnets are orchestrated to execute coordinated large-scale assaults such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, 
                                    which can severely compromise public safety and justice processes. Sidestep Security: This type of malware is strategically crafted to circumvent or neutralize security protocols. 
                                    Techniques include deploying rootkits to obscure the presence of malicious software, implementing backdoors to gain unauthorized access, 
                                    and programming logic bombs that execute harmful functions under specific conditions. 
                                    Such tactics pose significant threats to the integrity of criminal justice data and the secure operation of related information systems.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1.1 Data Kidnapping Data kidnapping mostly consists of Ransomware and Cryptomalware: Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer by locking the system. 
                                    It often demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. 
                                    Variants of ransomware may display deceitful messages claiming to be from law enforcement or software vendors, 
                                    alleging illegal activities or expired licenses to justify the lockdown. 
                                    This tactic can be particularly confusing and alarming for professionals in criminal justice, as it mimics legitimate legal authorities. 
                                    The ransomware may skip pretenses and straightforwardly demand payment to unlock the device. 
                                    Robust backup solutions and anti-malware systems are crucial for law enforcement agencies to mitigate the risk of such attacks. Cryptomalware: As a more severe form of ransomware, Cryptomalware encrypts all accessible files, rendering them inaccessible without a decryption key. 
                                    It may threaten to increase the ransom amount with each passing hour or day, adding urgency to its demands. 
                                    Newer variants are capable of spreading across network-connected devices, potentially crippling entire criminal justice systems. 
                                    Learning to recognize and avoid phishing attempts, which often distribute cryptomalware, is essential for protecting sensitive data and operational integrity.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1.2 Eavesdropping Eavesdropping mostly consists of Keyloggers and Spyware: Keyloggers: Keyloggers are tools that capture and store every keystroke made on a computer. 
                                    They can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), 
                                    posing a significant threat to privacy and security. Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based. 
                                    Software-based keyloggers are capable of taking screenshots and activating web cameras to capture images of the user.  
                                    They do not require physical access to be installed and can transmit captured data through the network. 
                                    Conversely, hardware-based keyloggers are usually small USB devices that are connected between a keyboard and computer, 
                                    typically in public locations where they are easier to install and retrieve later. 
                                    As they are external to the computer's operating system, they cannot be detected by standard antimalware software. Spyware: Spyware is malicious software that gathers information from a user's computer without their knowledge and sends it to third parties. 
                                    It can come in the form of automatic download software that self-installs without user interaction, potentially resulting in the installation of unauthorized software.
                                    Other forms include passive tracking technologies that collect data on user activities, system modifying software that changes user settings without permission, 
                                    and tracking software that monitors user behavior and collects data such as PII, increasing the risk of fraud and identity theft. 
                                    These aspects make spyware particularly dangerous for professionals in the criminal justice field, 
                                    where confidentiality and integrity of information are of the utmost importance.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1.3 Masquerading Masquerading mostly consists of Potentially Unwanted Programs, Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs): PUPs are applications that may be unwanted, despite often being bundled with software that users download and install. 
                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used to bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge. 
                                    In the criminal justice field, such vulnerabilities could be exploited to access confidential data, including case files and personal information. 
                                    Initially, developers may create backdoors for legitimate purposes such as maintenance. 
                                    However, if not removed, they pose a significant security risk as they can be discovered and used maliciously. Logic Bombs: Logic bombs are pieces of code that have been inserted into software and are designed to execute under specific conditions, 
                                    such as a specific time or when a certain action is performed. 
                                    For example, a logic bomb could be set to execute its attack three months after an employee left the firm, or after the 45th email sent by a clerk.
                                    A logic bomb could potentially be used to destroy data, disrupt system operations, or corrupt essential legal documents. 
                                    These are often hard to detect and can be planted by insiders who are trusted with access to sensitive systems. Rootkits: Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware in a system by intercepting and altering standard operating system processes. 
                                    Deeply embedded within the operating system, they are extremely difficult to detect and can give attackers full control of the system without the user's knowledge. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, rootkits represent a serious threat as they can be used to manipulate operations, 
                                    alter data, or steal information without detection for long periods.

                                    These security programs scan, detect, and remove threats by monitoring system activity and checking files against databases of known malware signatures. 
                                    They also employ heuristic and behavior-based detection methods to identify unknown malware based on suspicious behavior. 
                                    Additionally, these tools provide real-time protection by blocking potentially harmful programs and files before they can cause damage, 
                                    ensuring that digital environments remain secure and operational. Antivirus Software Antivirus software is designed to: Scan and Monitor: It continuously scans the computer and monitors activities to identify potential threats. Examine Files: New documents are inspected when they are opened, created, or closed to detect any signs of infection Virus Detection: Uses a scanning engine and a database of known virus signatures to detect infections. 
                                        Keeping the signature file updated is crucial as outdated signatures can lead to security breaches. Response Actions: Upon detecting a virus, the software can remove the virus, quarantine the infected file, or delete the file outright. Limitations: While antivirus software provides a valid means of security, it should not be seen as a comprehensive solution to all security threats. Comprehensive Antimalware Software Beyond basic antivirus functions, comprehensive antimalware includes: Intrusion Prevention: Analyzes incoming data from the network, actively blocking potential threats before they enter the computer. Reputation Protection: Classifies software and files as “dangerous,” “risky,” or “safe” based on information gathered from a global network, enhancing proactive security measures. Behavioral Protection: Watches for unusual behavior in software and automatically intervenes to block potentially malicious activities. Built-in Antimalware Both Windows and MacOS provide built-in antimalware solutions: Windows: Microsoft Defender Antivirus offers integrated security right out of the box. MacOS Apple XProtect provides a basic level of protection against malware. Compatibility Warning: When considering third-party antimalware software, it's important to ensure there are no conflicts between it and built-in systems.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.2.3 Firewalls Monitoring and managing firewalls is a vital component of a proper cybersecurity posture, 
                                    particularly for safeguarding the networks and computers used in sensitive sectors like criminal justice. 
                                    Firewalls act as the first line of defense, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
                                    This includes not only blocking unauthorized access but also managing data packets that might carry potential threats. 
                                    Effective firewall management involves regular updates and audits to ensure that all security protocols are up to date and functioning as intended. A Complete Guide to Firewall: How to Build A Secure Networking System Personal Firewalls Function: Personal firewalls act as packet filters that control the traffic entering or exiting a personal computer. Application Firewalls: These These are typically pre-installed on modern operating systems and are designed to allow traffic through only for specific, approved programs. 
                                        This helps to prevent an infected computer from spreading malware to other machines. Traffic Control: By default, these firewalls block all inbound traffic unless it has been explicitly allowed, while generally permitting outbound traffic unless specifically blocked. Network Firewalls Hardware-Based: Network firewalls are usually hardware devices placed at the edge of a network. Scope: They are designed to protect the entire network by inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic to decide whether to deny or allow it. Location: Often integrated into the routers provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), they serve as the first line of defense for all devices connected to the network. Best Practices for Firewall Management Regular Inspections: Periodically check firewalls to ensure they are active and functioning as expected. 
                                        This includes verifying that no unauthorized changes have been made to the rules—a common target for malware designed to weaken network defenses. Dual Use: For enhanced security, it is best to use both application and network firewalls. 
                                        This layered approach helps to secure individual machines as well as the entire network, contributing to a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.2.4 Ransonmware Prevention Effectively preventing ransomware involves a strategic combination of disconnecting potential entry points and maintaining secure backups.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security Case Study A Construction Company Gets Hammered by A Keylogger: Scenario: A small family-owned construction company made extensive use of online banking and automated clearing house (ACH) transfers. 
                                    Employees logged in with both a company and user-specific ID and password. Two challenge questions had to be answered for transactions over $1,000. The owner was notified that an ACH transfer of $10,000 was initiated by an unknown source. 
                                    They contacted the bank and identified that in just one week cyber criminals had made six transfers from the company bank accounts, totaling $550,000. 
                                    How? One of their employees had opened an email from what they thought was a materials supplier but was instead a malicious email laced with malware from an imposter account. Attack: Cyber criminals were able to install malware onto the company's computers, using a keylogger to capture the banking credentials. A keylogger is software that silently monitors computer keystrokes and sends the information to a cyber criminal. 
                                        They can then access banking and other financial services online, using valid account numbers and passwords. Response: The bank was able to retrieve only $200,000 of the stolen money in the first weeks, leaving a loss of $350,000. 
                                    The bank even drew over $220,000 on the business' line of credit to cover the fraudulent transfers. 
                                    Not having a cybersecurity plan in place delayed the company response to the fraud. The company also sought a cybersecurity forensics firm to: Help them complete a full cybersecurity review of their systems. Identify what the source of the incident was. Recommend upgrades to their security software. Impact The company shut down their bank account and pursued legal action to recover its losses. 
                                    The business recovered the remaining $350,000 with interest. No money for time and legal fees was recovered. Lessons Learned Get notified - set up transaction alerts on all credit, debit cards and bank accounts. Restrict access to sensitive accounts to only those employees who need access; change passwords often. Companies should evaluate their risk and evaluate cyber liability insurance options. Choose banks that offer multiple layers of authentication to access accounts and transactions. Create, maintain, and practice a cyber incident response plan that is rapidly implementable. Cyber criminals deliver and install malicious software via email. Train employees on email security. Discussion: Knowing how the firm responded, what would you have done differently? What are some steps you think the firm could have taken to prevent this incident? Is your business susceptible? How are you going to reduce your risk?

                                        It's comprised of websites that are not accessible through standard web browsers and often require specific software, configurations, 
                                        or permissions to access. This part of the internet includes paywalls, databases, password-protected sites, and other content that isn't meant for 
                                        public consumption. Now, the deep web itself isn't inherently criminal. It includes things like academic databases, private company intranets, and other 
                                        legitimate platforms that aren't designed to be indexed by search engines. However, it also harbors elements of the internet that are 
                                        used for illegal activities, which is where the term "dark web" often comes into play. In terms of criminal justice, the deep web is pertinent for a few reasons: Hidden Information: Criminals may use the deep web to hide information, such as their identities, communication, and 
                                                illicit transactions. This hidden nature poses challenges for law enforcement agencies trying to track criminal activities 
                                                and gather evidence. Investigative Leads: Despite being hidden, the deep web can provide valuable leads for criminal investigations. Law 
                                                enforcement agencies can use specialized tools and techniques to access certain parts of the deep web, uncovering information 
                                                crucial to solving cases. Cybercrime Infrastructure: Elements of cybercrime, such as botnets, malware distribution networks, and hacking forums, may operate 
                                                within the deep web. Understanding and infiltrating these networks are essential for combating cyber threats and safeguarding digital infrastructure. The Dark Web: The dark web is a hidden portion of the internet that requires specific software, configurations, or permissions to access. Unlike the deep web, which 
                                        includes all unindexed content, the dark web specifically refers to websites and content that exist on overlay networks and can only be accessed with 
                                        specialized tools like Tor (The Onion Router) browser. Renowned for its notorious mask of anonymity, the Dark Web emerges as a focal point for underground transactions and illicit activities making it a hub of 
                                        criminal commerce. The inception of the Dark Web can be traced back to the strategic endeavors of the United States (US) Department of Defense, which 
                                        sought to establish a secret and secure communication channel for its intelligence operatives. Illegal Marketplaces Anonumity and Encryption Cybercrime Extremism and Illegal Content

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 3: Internet Security 3.4.2 Strategies for Internet Defense Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): A VPN functions as a fortified conduit, establishing a secure connection between your device and the internet. In 
                                        this secure tunnel, your web traffic is rendered invisible to the prying eyes of hackers, shielding it from any 
                                        interception attempts. When you access the internet, your web traffic embarks on a journey that begins with its transmission to the Internet 
                                        Service Provider (ISP). En route, the traffic takes a detour through the VPN client software, where encryption wraps 
                                        your data in a protective cloak. This encrypted data then travels a secure tunnel, a virtual passageway safeguarded 
                                        against unauthorized access, until it reaches the VPN server. At this point, a transformation occurs where your 
                                        device's IP address and true location undergo a covert change, obscuring your digital footprint. The encrypted 
                                        message continues its journey through the secure tunnel until it reaches its final destination. It is at this 
                                        point that the encrypted layers are decrypted, revealing the original web traffic. This thorough process ensures 
                                        that your online activities remain concealed and secure, sealed from the probing eyes of potential cyber adversaries. Managing Browser Extensions: Managing browser extensions refers to controlling and overseeing the various add-ons, plugins, or extensions installed 
                                        in your web browser. These extensions can provide additional functionality, such as ad blocking, password management,
                                        or productivity tools. However, they can also pose security risks if not managed properly. Web Browser Security Settings: Web browser security settings refer to the configurable options and features within a web browser that help users 
                                        protect themselves against various online threats and enhance their overall internet security. These settings are 
                                        designed to mitigate risks such as malware infections, phishing attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to 
                                        sensitive information. Attachment Awareness: Attachments are considered risky because they can be used as effective vectors for delivering malware, conducting 
                                        phishing attacks, exploiting software vulnerabilities, leaking sensitive data, and manipulating users through social 
                                        engineering tactics. To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement robust email security measures, educate 
                                        users about the dangers of email attachments, and employ best practices for handling and verifying attachments before 
                                        opening them. Phishing Quiz Spam Filters: Spam filters are like gatekeepers for your email inbox. They're software tools that help keep out unwanted or harmful 
                                        emails, like spam. They work by looking at things like who sent the email, what's in the email, and whether it looks suspicious. Email Security Settings: Email security settings are configurations and features that help protect your email account from various threats, such as unauthorized 
                                        access, phishing attacks, malware, and spam. These settings are essential for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the 
                                        integrity and confidentiality of your email communications. Here are some common email security settings: Strong Passwords Two-Factor Authentication Account Recovery Options Email Encryption Spam Filtering Attachment Scanning Email Forwarding and Filtering Safe Browsing and Lin Protection Device Management Security Alerts and Notifications

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity 1.3 Passwords: Limitations and Best Practices Despite being a primary means of authentication, passwords often fail to provide strong defense against attackers.
                                    The vulnerabilities stem from these common issues: Weak Passwords: Many users select passwords that are too simple or easily guessable, like "123456," "password," or personal information such as names and birthdays. Reused Passwords: People tend to reuse passwords across multiple accounts for convenience. 
                                            If one account is compromised, other accounts become vulnerable. Short Passwords: Short passwords can be quickly cracked using brute force or dictionary attacks. Lack of Complexity: Passwords lacking a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols are easier to break. To create stronger passwords, consider these best practices: Length: Use a minimum of 12-16 characters. Longer passwords are exponentially more secure. Complexity: Include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
                                            Avoid predictable patterns like "1234" or "password1." Unique Passwords: Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts. 
                                            Each account should have a unique password to contain any security breach. Passphrases: Create a passphrase using a combination of unrelated words or phrases and substitute vowels for letters. 
                                            For instance, "DuskCrown!Blue42" is easy to remember, but "D4skCr0wn!Bl4342" will be much harder to guess while still being easy to remember. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Use MFA when possible, combining passwords with another authentication method like SMS codes, authentication apps, or biometrics. Password Managers: Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords securely. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords. Watch the following video to discover why these practices make passwords more effective:

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity Case Study Hotel CEO Finds Unwelcome Guests in Email Account: Scenario: The CEO of a boutique hotel realized their business had become the victim of wire fraud when the bookkeeper began to receive insufficient fund notifications for regularly recurring bills. 
                                    A review of the accounting records exposed a serious problem. 
                                    At some point a few weeks before, the CEO had clicked on a link in an email that they thought was from the IRS. 
                                    It wasn't. When they clicked the link and entered their credentials, the cyber criminals captured the CEO's login information, giving them full access to intimate business and personal details. Attack: Social engineering, phishing attack. A phishing attack is a form of social engineering by which cyber criminals attempt to trick individuals by creating and sending fake emails that appear to be from an authentic source, such as a business or colleague. 
                                        The email might ask you to confirm personal account information such as a password or prompt you to open a malicious attachment that infects your computer with malware. Response: The hotel's cash reserves were depleted. 
                                    The fraudulent transfers amounted to more than $1 million. 
                                    The hotel also contacted a cybersecurity firm to help them mitigate the risk of a repeat attack. Impact: The business lost $1 million to an account in China. 
                                    The funds were not recovered. Lessons Learned Teach staff about the dangers of clicking on unsolicited email links and attachments, and the need to stay alert for warning signs of fraudulent emails. 
                                        Engage in regular email security training. Implement stringent wire transfer protocols and include a secondary form of validation. Have a cyber incident response plan ready to implement! Discussion: Knowing how the firm responded, what would you have done differently? What are some steps you think the firm could have taken to prevent this incident? Is your business susceptible to this kind of attack? How are you going to reduce your risk?

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.0 What is Computer Security? Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                                    This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                                    and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Knowledge of computer security can enhance your ability to investigate cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking. 
                                        Insight into the methods used in these crimes facilitates more efficient measures for prevention, detection, and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Criminal justice agencies must comply with various legal standards and regulations regarding data protection and privacy. 
                                        Non-compliance can lead to legal ramifications and harm to the institution's reputation. 2.1 What is Malware? Malware is software that enters your computer system, without your knowledge, and carries out unwanted actions.
                                    Often, these actions damage, disrupt, or steal data on your computer; but they can even include planting a foothold for future access to your computer.
                                    If we think of your computer as a fortress, holding and protecting all of your valuable goods and information, then we can view malware as any type of non-human invader 
                                    that is trying to control access to those valuables. As there are many types of malware, it can be difficult to categorize them. 
                                    So, a common practice is to categorize them based on their primary action.
                                    These can be broken down into: Kidnap Data Eavesdrop Masquerade Serve as Launchpad Sidestep External Resource Link: Cybersecurity & infrastructure Security Agency Malware Tip Card Malware Primary Actions Kidnap Data: This type of malware specifically targets and restricts access to critical data, systems, or devices. 
                                    The predominant form, ransomware, encrypts essential files and systems, demanding payment for decryption keys. 
                                    Such attacks can cripple the operational capabilities of law enforcement departments, courts, corrections facilities, and legal firms, 
                                    resulting in substantial operational disruptions and significant financial losses. Eavesdrop: Eavesdropping malware captures and transmits user data without consent. 
                                    Examples include keyloggers that record keystrokes, spyware that monitors user activities, and other software that can access device cameras and microphones. 
                                    These tools are used for stealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and personal identification information. Masquerade: This category includes malware that impersonates legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it under false pretenses. 
                                    Once operational, it executes malicious activities that can compromise legal investigations and sensitive data. 
                                    Specifically, criminal justice professionals should be wary of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Trojans. 
                                    These often come bundled with legitimate software or misrepresent their functionality, posing significant risks to the integrity of criminal justice systems and operations. Serve as Launchpad: Launchpad malware hijacks infected devices to initiate additional cyberattacks. 
                                    This includes viruses and worms that autonomously replicate and circulate across multiple systems, as well as bots that integrate into botnets. 
                                    These botnets are orchestrated to execute coordinated large-scale assaults such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, 
                                    which can severely compromise public safety and justice processes. Sidestep Security: This type of malware is strategically crafted to circumvent or neutralize security protocols. 
                                    Techniques include deploying rootkits to obscure the presence of malicious software, implementing backdoors to gain unauthorized access, 
                                    and programming logic bombs that execute harmful functions under specific conditions. 
                                    Such tactics pose significant threats to the integrity of criminal justice data and the secure operation of related information systems. 2.1.1 Data Kidnapping Data kidnapping mostly consists of Ransomware and Cryptomalware: Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer by locking the system. 
                                    It often demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. 
                                    Variants of ransomware may display deceitful messages claiming to be from law enforcement or software vendors, 
                                    alleging illegal activities or expired licenses to justify the lockdown. 
                                    This tactic can be particularly confusing and alarming for professionals in criminal justice, as it mimics legitimate legal authorities. 
                                    The ransomware may skip pretenses and straightforwardly demand payment to unlock the device. 
                                    Robust backup solutions and anti-malware systems are crucial for law enforcement agencies to mitigate the risk of such attacks. Cryptomalware: As a more severe form of ransomware, Cryptomalware encrypts all accessible files, rendering them inaccessible without a decryption key. 
                                    It may threaten to increase the ransom amount with each passing hour or day, adding urgency to its demands. 
                                    Newer variants are capable of spreading across network-connected devices, potentially crippling entire criminal justice systems. 
                                    Learning to recognize and avoid phishing attempts, which often distribute cryptomalware, is essential for protecting sensitive data and operational integrity. 2.1.2 Eavesdropping Eavesdropping mostly consists of Keyloggers and Spyware: Keyloggers: Keyloggers are tools that capture and store every keystroke made on a computer. 
                                    They can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), 
                                    posing a significant threat to privacy and security. Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based. 
                                    Software-based keyloggers are capable of taking screenshots and activating web cameras to capture images of the user.  
                                    They do not require physical access to be installed and can transmit captured data through the network. 
                                    Conversely, hardware-based keyloggers are usually small USB devices that are connected between a keyboard and computer, 
                                    typically in public locations where they are easier to install and retrieve later. 
                                    As they are external to the computer's operating system, they cannot be detected by standard antimalware software. Spyware: Spyware is malicious software that gathers information from a user's computer without their knowledge and sends it to third parties. 
                                    It can come in the form of automatic download software that self-installs without user interaction, potentially resulting in the installation of unauthorized software.
                                    Other forms include passive tracking technologies that collect data on user activities, system modifying software that changes user settings without permission, 
                                    and tracking software that monitors user behavior and collects data such as PII, increasing the risk of fraud and identity theft. 
                                    These aspects make spyware particularly dangerous for professionals in the criminal justice field, 
                                    where confidentiality and integrity of information are of the utmost importance. 2.1.3 Masquerading Masquerading mostly consists of Potentially Unwanted Programs, Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs): PUPs are applications that may be unwanted, despite often being bundled with software that users download and install. 
                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data. 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources. 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used of bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge. 
                                    In the criminal justice field, such vulnerabilities could be exploited to access confidential data, including case files and personal information. 
                                    Initially, developers may create backdoors for legitimate purposes such as maintenance.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity 1.0: Cybersecurity is Ongoing Everything we do these days is online. You would think we could download antivirus 
                                    software by now and have protection covered, right? Unfortunately, the reality is 
                                    not that simple. As quickly as protections are developed, new vulnerabilities are 
                                    exposed. No single product guarantees online security. Instead, cybersecurity is an ongoing balancing act. Technologies emerge and new vulnerabilities 
                                    are discovered. Those vulnerabilities are addressed, and as attacker tools improve, 
                                    more risks arise. Cybersecurity professionals are constantly identifying and 
                                    reacting to new threats. As you can see below, A SINGLE ATTACK hit 1.3 billion
                                    targets. That's more than 1 in 8 people impacted globally by one threat actor! Click
                                    the image to see the full interactive version from Information is Beautiful. The scale of cyber threats is massive. The stakes are high, and the consequences of a breach can be catastrophic. 
                                    That's why cybersecurity is a critical field that requires constant vigilance and innovation to stay ahead of the threats. Challenges of Cybersecurity These are a few of the reasons why cybersecurity is tough to implement: Devices are universally connected: Attackers can come from anywhere across the globe. Technology keeps improving: Attackers can now launch attacks against millions of computers within minutes. 
                                        Vast networks of attacker-controlled computers can easily overwhelm targets. Attack tools are also improving: Attack software is available to novices and pros alike. 
                                        Attack tools can vary their behavior, so the same attack looks different each time. Vendors can't keep up: Vulnerabilities are detected quickly with these sophisticated tools. 
                                        Vendors are overwhelmed trying to keep up with updating products, and security updates are challenging to implement in a timely fashion. User confusion: Users are forced to make difficult security decisions with little instruction. 1.1 What is Information Security? Just as we protect our homes against burglars with a security system, we also protect our personal information against threats (such as identity theft!). 
                                    Information security is the practice of protecting information with value for people and organizations. 
                                    As data is transmitted, processed and stored, it must be protected. CIA: The Three Protections Confidentiality Confidentiality Only authorized parties should be able to view the information (example: credit card information). Integrity Integrity Information should be free from tampering (example: amount of purchase). Availability Availability The right people need to be able to access data as needed (example: security not so complex that merchant can’t access order information). AAA: Three Considerations Authentication Authentication Ensures user is not an impostor (example: 2FA to log on) Authorization Authorization Permission to use technology resources (example: clerk allowed to see order history for customer) Accounting Accounting Tracks events (example: who accessed server when) Information security consists of three layers: Products, People and Policy Products: From door locks to sophisticated firewalls, physical products protect information. People: The folks who implement and properly use security products. Policy: Established by organizations so people correctly use security products. 1.2: Terminology Terminology: Here's a quick rundown of basic cybersecurity jargon. We will use these terms to discuss attacks and defenses. Threat: action that could cause harm. Asset: item with value (information in our case!). Vulnerability: weakness in security. Risk: exposure to danger. Threat agent: person who could carry out the threat. Attack vector: how the attack could occur. Risks: Risks have their own associated vocabulary. Risk avoidance: avoid the risk in the first place, such as not storing information that could be stolen. Risk acceptance: accept there's a risk and do nothing. Risk deterrence: deter threat actors by advertising measures such as warnings and legal actions. Risk mitigation: make the risk less serious, such as by storing information in separate locations. Risk transference: hand the risk to someone else, such as by buying insurance. 1.3: Attacks and Defenses Attacks and attackers come in many forms: Attackers: Cybercriminals: seek fortune, not fame. Script kiddies: in it for thrills and notoriety. Brokers: sell vulnerabilities to highest bidder. Insiders: retaliate against own organization. Cyberterrorists: seek to cause pani. Hacktivists: think they are righting wrongs. State attackers: spy on and disrupt governments and citizens. Attacks: Point-of-sale (POS) attacks, where “memory scrapers” steal card information at time of transaction. Keyless entry system attacks, where threat actors amplify the signal of remote keys inside homes and gain access to vehicles parked outside. Home wireless network attacks, launching malicious software on home networks through a vulnerability found in 90 major manufacturers' products. Healthcare breaches are a huge problem and have even shut down hospitals entirely. Defenses: Block attacks: A strong security perimeter will protect you. Firewalls, VPNs, strong passwords, and even simple locks on doors can keep your information safer. Update defenses: Always keep hardware and software updated and install operating system security updates as soon as possible to protect against known threats. Minimize losses: Keep backup copies of data and have a recovery policy in place in case a successful attack occurs. Stay alert: Make sure all users know how to safely use the system. Stay motivated and keep your eyes peeled! Information security is the responsibility of all users. 1.4: Personal Security Password Attacks: Despite being the primary means of authentication for personal security, passwords are not strong defenses against attackers. 
                                    Users frequently choose weak passwords and use the same password multiple times. 
                                    With the help of AI, it is easier than ever before to crack poor passwords. Password Vulnerability: The most frequently used passwords are alarmingly simple: With easy-to-access AI hardware, those common passwords can be cracked almost instantly: Password cracking tools exist for anyone to explore: 2.1 Quiz

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice 3.0: What is Internet Security? Internet Security is the protection of digital information and systems from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats 
                            specifically related to online activities. Internet Security is important because it emphasizes the critical role of internet 
                            security in safeguarding sensitive information, preventing cybercrimes, and maintaining public safety in the digital realm. Navigating the Web: Exploring Internet Security and Beyond. Surface Web: The world wide web or surface web is the part of the internet that is easily accessible and searchable through standard search engines 
                                        like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. It's the web that most people interact with on a daily basis. The surface web itself is not vulnerable, but the vulnerability of individual websites or online platforms depends on certain factors, 
                                        including their security measures, updates, and how well they protect against potential threats. On the defensive side, cybersecurity pros use tools to check the WWW for signs of trouble, like leaked passwords or discussions about 
                                        cyber attacks. This helps them track down and be on top of problems before they become serious. Attackers also use the WWW to share hacking tools, plan attacks, and exchange information. This means security teams must always be 
                                        alert and ready to adapt to new methods coming from attackers. The Deep Web: The deep web refers to the portion of the internet that isn't indexed by traditional search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. 
                                        It's comprised of websites that are not accessible through standard web browsers and often require specific software, configurations, 
                                        or permissions to access. This part of the internet includes paywalls, databases, password-protected sites, and other content that isn't meant for 
                                        public consumption. Now, the deep web itself isn't inherently criminal. It includes things like academic databases, private company intranets, and other 
                                        legitimate platforms that aren't designed to be indexed by search engines. However, it also harbors elements of the internet that are 
                                        used for illegal activities, which is where the term "dark web" often comes into play. In terms of criminal justice, the deep web is pertinent for a few reasons: Hidden Information: Criminals may use the deep web to hide information, such as their identities, communication, and 
                                                illicit transactions. This hidden nature poses challenges for law enforcement agencies trying to track criminal activities 
                                                and gather evidence. Investigative Leads: Despite being hidden, the deep web can provide valuable leads for criminal investigations. Law 
                                                enforcement agencies can use specialized tools and techniques to access certain parts of the deep web, uncovering information 
                                                crucial to solving cases. Cybercrime Infrastructure: Elements of cybercrime, such as botnets, malware distribution networks, and hacking forums, may operate 
                                                within the deep web. Understanding and infiltrating these networks are essential for combating cyber threats and safeguarding digital infrastructure. The Dark Web: The dark web is a hidden portion of the internet that requires specific software, configurations, or permissions to access. Unlike the deep web, which 
                                        includes all unindexed content, the dark web specifically refers to websites and content that exist on overlay networks and can only be accessed with 
                                        specialized tools like Tor (The Onion Router) browser. Renowned for its notorious mask of anonymity, the Dark Web emerges as a focal point for underground transactions and illicit activities making it a hub of 
                                        criminal commerce. The inception of the Dark Web can be traced back to the strategic endeavors of the United States (US) Department of Defense, which 
                                        sought to establish a secret and secure communication channel for its intelligence operatives. Illegal Marketplaces Anonumity and Encryption Cybercrime Extremism and Illegal Content 3.1 Internet Security Risks 3.1.1 User Device Threats Browser Dangers Email Risks 3.1.2 Threats From Web Servers Malvertising The random ads seen on popular websites are outsourced by the owner and not always monitored for malware that 
                                        is in disguise. Drive-By Downloads Viewing a website that is already infected with malware will infect your computer. The attacker is exploiting 
                                            the websites vulnerability and injecting it with harmful malicious content. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) An attack using scripting that originates from one site to impact another on the users computer. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) An attacker takes advantage of an authentication token that a websites send to the user. This can then result 
                                            in the user doing the work on the attackers behalf. 3.1.3 Transmission Risks Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) In a MITM attack, a bad actor secretly gets in the middle of a conversation between two parties, 
                                        like a user and a website. They sneakily listen in on the conversation and can even change what's being said or done. 
                                        It's like someone eavesdropping on your phone call without you knowing, but in the digital world. These attacks can 
                                        happen on networks or even on your Wi-Fi connection, so it's important to be cautious, especially when sharing sensitive 
                                        information online. Types of MITM Attacks Wi-Fi Eavesdropping Session Hijacking Man-in-the-Browser Email Hijacking ARP Cache Poisoning Session Replay 3.1.4 Common Internet Threats Malware Phishing Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial data 
                                            by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. Cyber Attacks Online Scams Identity Theft - A type of cybercrime in which an individual's personal information is stolen and used by someone else for fraudulent 
                                                purposes. This stolen information can include Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, 
                                                bank account details, and other sensitive data. Fake Websites - Security Headers is a website that allows you to test and analyze the HTTP security headers of any website. 
                                            You can enter a website's URL, and the tool will provide a report on the security headers it uses and 
                                            recommendations for improvement. It's entirely web-based and doesn't require any downloads. Analyze Your URL Fraudulent Online Transactions - Fraudulent online transactions occur when someone makes unauthorized purchases or conducts deceptive activities using 
                                            another person's financial information, such as credit card numbers or bank account details. These transactions can 
                                            lead to financial losses, identity theft, and other adverse consequences for victims. 3.2 Internet Defenses 3.2.1 Securing the Web Browser 3.2.1.1 Security-Related Indicators Security-related indicators in terms of internet security refer to various signs or signals that can indicate 
                                        potential security threats, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activities. These indicators are often monitored by 
                                        security professionals, automated systems, or users themselves to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. Indicators: Unauthorized Access Attempts Changes in System Configurations Suspicious File or Network Activity Certificate Revocation Security Alerts from Intrusion Detection Systems/ Intrusion Prevention Systems 3.2.1.2 Web Browser Security Settings Web browser security settings refer to the configurable options and features within a web browser that help users 
                                        protect themselves against various online threats and enhance their overall internet security. These settings are 
                                        designed to mitigate risks such as malware infections, phishing attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to 
                                        sensitive information. 3.2.1.3 Managing Browser Extensions Managing browser extensions refers to controlling and overseeing the various add-ons, plugins, or extensions installed 
                                        in your web browser. These extensions can provide additional functionality, such as ad blocking, password management,
                                        or productivity tools. However, they can also pose security risks if not managed properly. 3.2.1.4 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) A VPN functions as a fortified conduit, establishing a secure connection between your device and the internet. In 
                                        this secure tunnel, your web traffic is rendered invisible to the prying eyes of hackers, shielding it from any 
                                        interception attempts. When you access the internet, your web traffic embarks on a journey that begins with its transmission to the Internet 
                                        Service Provider (ISP). En route, the traffic takes a detour through the VPN client software, where encryption wraps 
                                        your data in a protective cloak. This encrypted data then travels a secure tunnel, a virtual passageway safeguarded 
                                        against unauthorized access, until it reaches the VPN server. At this point, a transformation occurs where your 
                                        device's IP address and true location undergo a covert change, obscuring your digital footprint. The encrypted 
                                        message continues its journey through the secure tunnel until it reaches its final destination. It is at this 
                                        point that the encrypted layers are decrypted, revealing the original web traffic. This thorough process ensures 
                                        that your online activities remain concealed and secure, sealed from the probing eyes of potential cyber adversaries. 3.2.2 Email Defenses Attachments: Attachments are considered risky because they can be used as effective vectors for delivering malware, conducting 
                                        phishing attacks, exploiting software vulnerabilities, leaking sensitive data, and manipulating users through social 
                                        engineering tactics. To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement robust email security measures, educate 
                                        users about the dangers of email attachments, and employ best practices for handling and verifying attachments before 
                                        opening them. Phishing Quiz Spam Filters: Spam filters are like gatekeepers for your email inbox. They're software tools that help keep out unwanted or harmful 
                                        emails, like spam. They work by looking at things like who sent the email, what's in the email, and whether it looks suspicious. Email Security Settings: Email security settings are configurations and features that help protect your email account from various threats, such as unauthorized 
                                        access, phishing attacks, malware, and spam. These settings are essential for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the 
                                        integrity and confidentiality of your email communications. Here are some common email security settings: Strong Passwords Two-Factor Authentication Account Recovery Options Email Encryption Spam Filtering Attachment Scanning Email Forwarding and Filtering Safe Browsing and Lin Protection Device Management Security Alerts and Notifications 3.3 Cybercrime and Law Enforcement 3.3.1 Digital Evidence Collection from Law Enforcement Agencies Digital evidence collection is an integral component of internet security, enabling organizations and law enforcement 
                                    agencies to investigate cybercrimes, respond to security incidents, identify threats, protect against future attacks,

Privacy Criminal justice professionals must ensure that privacy and data management practices safeguard sensitive information. Backup Strategies: Effective backups provide an essential safety net for restoring sensitive data after breaches. 
                                            If compromised data can't be restored, investigations could be at risk. Disconnect and Isolate Devices: Isolating devices is critical for ensuring that sensitive data remains private. 
                                            Without physical disconnection, attackers could access data indirectly via connected storage. 1.1 What is Information Security? Just as we protect our homes against burglars with a security system, we also protect our personal information against threats (such as identity theft!). 
                                    Information security is the practice of protecting information with value for people and organizations. 
                                    As data is transmitted, processed and stored, it must be protected. Information security consists of three layers: Products, People and Policy Products: From door locks to sophisticated firewalls, physical products protect information. People: The folks who implement and properly use security products. Policy: Established by organizations so people correctly use security products. 1.2: Terminology Terminology: Here is a quick rundown of basic cybersecurity jargon. 
                                    We will use these terms to discuss attacks and defenses. Threat: action that could cause harm. Asset: item with value (information in our case!). Vulnerability: weakness in security. Risk: exposure to danger. Threat agent: person who could carry out the threat. Attack vector: how the attack could occur. Risks: Risks have their own associated vocabulary. Risk avoidance: avoid the risk in the first place, such as not storing information that could be stolen. Risk acceptance: accept there's a risk and do nothing. Risk deterrence: deter threat actors by advertising measures such as warnings and legal actions. Risk mitigation: make the risk less serious, such as by storing information in separate locations. Risk transference: hand the risk to someone else, such as by buying insurance. 1.3: Attacks and Defenses Attacks and attackers come in many forms: Attackers: Cybercriminals: seek fortune, not fame. Script kiddies: in it for thrills and notoriety. Brokers: sell vulnerabilities to highest bidder. Insiders: retaliate against own organization. Cyberterrorists: seek to cause pani. Hacktivists: think they are righting wrongs. State attackers: spy on and disrupt governments and citizens. Attacks: Point-of-sale (POS) attacks, where “memory scrapers” steal card information at time of transaction. Keyless entry system attacks, where threat actors amplify the signal of remote keys inside homes and gain access to vehicles parked outside. Home wireless network attacks, launching malicious software on home networks through a vulnerability found in 90 major manufacturers' products. Healthcare breaches are a huge problem and have even shut down hospitals entirely. Defenses: Block attacks: A strong security perimeter will protect you. Firewalls, VPNs, strong passwords, and even simple locks on doors can keep your information safer. Update defenses: Always keep hardware and software updated and install operating system security updates as soon as possible to protect against known threats. Minimize losses: Keep backup copies of data and have a recovery policy in place in case a successful attack occurs. Stay alert: Make sure all users know how to safely use the system. Stay motivated and keep your eyes peeled! Information security is the responsibility of all users. 1.4: Personal Security Password Attacks: Despite being the primary means of authentication for personal security, passwords are not strong defenses against attackers. 
                                    Users frequently choose weak passwords and use the same password multiple times. 
                                    With the help of AI, it is easier than ever before to crack poor passwords. Password Vulnerability: The most frequently used passwords are alarmingly simple: With easy-to-access AI hardware, those common passwords can be cracked almost instantly: Password cracking tools exist for anyone to explore: CIA: The Three Protections Confidentiality Confidentiality Only authorized parties should be able to view the information (example: credit card information). Integrity Integrity Information should be free from tampering (example: amount of purchase). Availability Availability The right people need to be able to access data as needed (example: security not so complex that merchant can’t access order information). AAA: Three Considerations Authentication Authentication Ensures user is not an impostor (example: 2FA to log on) Authorization Authorization Permission to use technology resources (example: clerk allowed to see order history for customer) Accounting Accounting Tracks events (example: who accessed server when)

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice What is Computer Security? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                            This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                            and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Knowledge of computer security can enhance your ability to investigate cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking. 
                                        Insight into the methods used in these crimes facilitates more efficient measures for prevention, detection, and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Criminal justice agencies must comply with various legal standards and regulations regarding data protection and privacy. 
                                        Non-compliance can lead to legal ramifications and harm to the institution's reputation. 2.1 What is Malware? Malware is software that enters your computer system, without your knowledge, and carries out unwanted actions.
                                    Often, these actions damage, disrupt, or steal data on your computer; but they can even include planting a foothold for future access to your computer.
                                    If we think of your computer as a fortress, holding and protecting all of your valuable goods and information, then we can view malware as any type of non-human invader 
                                    that is trying to control access to those valuables. As there are many types of malware, it can be difficult to categorize them. 
                                    So, a common practice is to categorize them based on their primary action.
                                    These can be broken down into: Kidnap Data Eavesdrop Masquerade Serve as Launchpad Sidestep External Resource Link: Cybersecurity & infrastructure Security Agency Malware Tip Card Malware Primary Actions Kidnap Data: This type of malware specifically targets and restricts access to critical data, systems, or devices. 
                                    The predominant form, ransomware, encrypts essential files and systems, demanding payment for decryption keys. 
                                    Such attacks can cripple the operational capabilities of law enforcement departments, courts, corrections facilities, and legal firms, 
                                    resulting in substantial operational disruptions and significant financial losses. Eavesdrop: Eavesdropping malware captures and transmits user data without consent. 
                                    Examples include keyloggers that record keystrokes, spyware that monitors user activities, and other software that can access device cameras and microphones. 
                                    These tools are used for stealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and personal identification information. Masquerade: This category includes malware that impersonates legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it under false pretenses. 
                                    Once operational, it executes malicious activities that can compromise legal investigations and sensitive data. 
                                    Specifically, criminal justice professionals should be wary of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Trojans. 
                                    These often come bundled with legitimate software or misrepresent their functionality, posing significant risks to the integrity of criminal justice systems and operations. Serve as Launchpad: Launchpad malware hijacks infected devices to initiate additional cyberattacks. 
                                    This includes viruses and worms that autonomously replicate and circulate across multiple systems, as well as bots that integrate into botnets. 
                                    These botnets are orchestrated to execute coordinated large-scale assaults such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, 
                                    which can severely compromise public safety and justice processes. Sidestep Security: This type of malware is strategically crafted to circumvent or neutralize security protocols. 
                                    Techniques include deploying rootkits to obscure the presence of malicious software, implementing backdoors to gain unauthorized access, 
                                    and programming logic bombs that execute harmful functions under specific conditions. 
                                    Such tactics pose significant threats to the integrity of criminal justice data and the secure operation of related information systems. 2.1.1 Data Kidnapping Data kidnapping mostly consists of Ransomware and Cryptomalware: Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer by locking the system. 
                                    It often demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. 
                                    Variants of ransomware may display deceitful messages claiming to be from law enforcement or software vendors, 
                                    alleging illegal activities or expired licenses to justify the lockdown. 
                                    This tactic can be particularly confusing and alarming for professionals in criminal justice, as it mimics legitimate legal authorities. 
                                    The ransomware may skip pretenses and straightforwardly demand payment to unlock the device. 
                                    Robust backup solutions and anti-malware systems are crucial for law enforcement agencies to mitigate the risk of such attacks. Cryptomalware: As a more severe form of ransomware, Cryptomalware encrypts all accessible files, rendering them inaccessible without a decryption key. 
                                    It may threaten to increase the ransom amount with each passing hour or day, adding urgency to its demands. 
                                    Newer variants are capable of spreading across network-connected devices, potentially crippling entire criminal justice systems. 
                                    Learning to recognize and avoid phishing attempts, which often distribute cryptomalware, is essential for protecting sensitive data and operational integrity. 2.1.2 Eavesdropping Eavesdropping mostly consists of Keyloggers and Spyware: Keyloggers: Keyloggers are tools that capture and store every keystroke made on a computer. 
                                    They can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), 
                                    posing a significant threat to privacy and security. Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based. 
                                    Software-based keyloggers are capable of taking screenshots and activating web cameras to capture images of the user.  
                                    They do not require physical access to be installed and can transmit captured data through the network. 
                                    Conversely, hardware-based keyloggers are usually small USB devices that are connected between a keyboard and computer, 
                                    typically in public locations where they are easier to install and retrieve later. 
                                    As they are external to the computer's operating system, they cannot be detected by standard antimalware software. Spyware: Spyware is malicious software that gathers information from a user's computer without their knowledge and sends it to third parties. 
                                    It can come in the form of automatic download software that self-installs without user interaction, potentially resulting in the installation of unauthorized software.
                                    Other forms include passive tracking technologies that collect data on user activities, system modifying software that changes user settings without permission, 
                                    and tracking software that monitors user behavior and collects data such as PII, increasing the risk of fraud and identity theft. 
                                    These aspects make spyware particularly dangerous for professionals in the criminal justice field, 
                                    where confidentiality and integrity of information are of the utmost importance. 2.1.3 Masquerading Masquerading mostly consists of Potentially Unwanted Programs, Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs): PUPs are applications that may be unwanted, despite often being bundled with software that users download and install. 
                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data. 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources. 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used of bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge. 
                                    In the criminal justice field, such vulnerabilities could be exploited to access confidential data, including case files and personal information. 
                                    Initially, developers may create backdoors for legitimate purposes such as maintenance. 
                                    However, if not removed, they pose a significant security risk as they can be discovered and used maliciously. Logic Bombs: Logic bombs are pieces of code that have been inserted into software and are designed to execute under specific conditions, 
                                    such as a specific time or when a certain action is performed. 
                                    For example, a logic bomb could be set to execute its attack three months after an employee left the firm, or after the 45th email sent by a clerk.
                                    A logic bomb could potentially be used to destroy data, disrupt system operations, or corrupt essential legal documents. 
                                    These are often hard to detect and can be planted by insiders who are trusted with access to sensitive systems. Rootkits: Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware in a system by intercepting and altering standard operating system processes. 
                                    Deeply embedded within the operating system, they are extremely difficult to detect and can give attackers full control of the system without the user's knowledge. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, rootkits represent a serious threat as they can be used to manipulate operations, 
                                    alter data, or steal information without detection for long periods. 2.2 Defending Against Malware As criminal justice professionals, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of your computer systems is paramount. 
                                    Malware poses a significant threat to your data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or even disruption of your essential services.

                                        Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware. Antivirus and Anti-malware Software: Using antivirus and anti-malware programs provides a critical first line of defense, actively scanning and removing threats before they can cause harm. Monitor Firewalls: Configuring firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic can prevent malicious activities and block unauthorized access Training and Awareness: Regular training sessions for all employees can help recognize phishing attempts and suspicious links, which are common vectors for malware. Backup and Recovery Plans: Maintaining regular backups of important data ensures that you can restore your system to a clean state in case of a malware attack, minimizing downtime and data loss. 2.2.1 Security Updates Regularly Updating software and security is a crucial to maintaining a proper cybersecurity posture. 
                                    It requires the systematic updating of software on computers to protect against vulnerabilities. Automatic Updates: Both Windows and macOS operating systems feature built-in mechanisms that regularly check for software updates over the internet. 
                                        These services ensure that your computer system is always equipped with the latest security features and fixes. Update Services: For a computer to receive these updates, it must be configured to interact with the vendor's update service. 
                                        This ensures that any patches released by the vendor are automatically applied to your system. Security Patches: Often referred to simply as patches, these updates target specific vulnerabilities within the system. 
                                        By addressing these vulnerabilities, patches play a critical role in fortifying the system against potential exploits and malware infections. Instructional Resources: For Windows users, updates can be managed and reviewed at the Windows Update page For MacOS users, guidance on updates is available at th MacOS Update Guide 2.2.2 Antimalware Software Antimalware and antivirus software are essential tools designed to protect computers and networks from malware. 
                                    These security programs scan, detect, and remove threats by monitoring system activity and checking files against databases of known malware signatures. 
                                    They also employ heuristic and behavior-based detection methods to identify unknown malware based on suspicious behavior. 
                                    Additionally, these tools provide real-time protection by blocking potentially harmful programs and files before they can cause damage, 
                                    ensuring that digital environments remain secure and operational. Antivirus Software Antivirus software is designed to: Scan and Monitor: It continuously scans the computer and monitors activities to identify potential threats. Examine Files: New documents are inspected when they are opened, created, or closed to detect any signs of infection Virus Detection: Uses a scanning engine and a database of known virus signatures to detect infections. 
                                        Keeping the signature file updated is crucial as outdated signatures can lead to security breaches. Response Actions: Upon detecting a virus, the software can remove the virus, quarantine the infected file, or delete the file outright. Limitations: While antivirus software provides a valid means of security, it should not be seen as a comprehensive solution to all security threats. Comprehensive Antimalware Software Beyond basic antivirus functions, comprehensive antimalware includes: Intrusion Prevention: Analyzes incoming data from the network, actively blocking potential threats before they enter the computer. Reputation Protection: Classifies software and files as “dangerous,” “risky,” or “safe” based on information gathered from a global network, enhancing proactive security measures. Behavioral Protection: Watches for unusual behavior in software and automatically intervenes to block potentially malicious activities. Built-in Antimalware Both Windows and MacOS provide built-in antimalware solutions: Windows: Microsoft Defender Antivirus offers integrated security right out of the box. MacOS Apple XProtect provides a basic level of protection against malware. Compatibility Warning: When considering third-party antimalware software, it's important to ensure there are no conflicts between it and built-in systems. 
                                        Always verify compatibility to avoid potential security gaps or performance issues. 2.2.3 Firewalls Monitoring and managing firewalls is a vital component of a proper cybersecurity posture, 
                                    particularly for safeguarding the networks and computers used in sensitive sectors like criminal justice. 
                                    Firewalls act as the first line of defense, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
                                    This includes not only blocking unauthorized access but also managing data packets that might carry potential threats. 
                                    Effective firewall management involves regular updates and audits to ensure that all security protocols are up to date and functioning as intended. Personal Firewalls Function: Personal firewalls act as packet filters that control the traffic entering or exiting a personal computer. Application Firewalls: These These are typically pre-installed on modern operating systems and are designed to allow traffic through only for specific, approved programs. 
                                        This helps to prevent an infected computer from spreading malware to other machines. Traffic Control: By default, these firewalls block all inbound traffic unless it has been explicitly allowed, while generally permitting outbound traffic unless specifically blocked. Network Firewalls Hardware-Based: Network firewalls are usually hardware devices placed at the edge of a network. Scope: They are designed to protect the entire network by inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic to decide whether to deny or allow it. Location: Often integrated into the routers provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), they serve as the first line of defense for all devices connected to the network. Best Practices for Firewall Management Regular Inspections: Periodically check firewalls to ensure they are active and functioning as expected. 
                                        This includes verifying that no unauthorized changes have been made to the rules—a common target for malware designed to weaken network defenses. Dual Use: For enhanced security, it is best to use both application and network firewalls. 
                                        This layered approach helps to secure individual machines as well as the entire network, contributing to a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity. 2.2.4 Ransonmware Prevention Effectively preventing ransomware involves a strategic combination of disconnecting potential entry points and maintaining secure backups. Disconnect and Isolate Devices Disconnecting devices can significantly reduce the risk of ransomware infection. Local and Networked Devices: Any device with a drive letter (C:\, D:\, etc.) or networked storage that syncs automatically poses a risk if compromised. 
                                        Using air gaps, or physical separations, between computers and storage devices can be an effective deterrent. USB and External Drives: Physically unplugging USB storage devices and unmounting secondary hard drives when not in use can make them invisible to ransomware attacks. Network Shared Directories: Limiting access to these directories by requiring login credentials from specific user accounts adds an additional layer of security. Cloud Storage: Turning off automatic synchronization and requiring manual login for cloud services decreases the vulnerability of cloud-stored data. Backup Data Backups are essential for recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. Data Copies: Regularly updated backups should be stored in secure locations, isolated from the network. 
                                        This prevents ransomware from accessing both primary and backup data, allowing for recovery without paying the ransom. What is Computer Security? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                            This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                            and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Knowledge of computer security can enhance your ability to investigate cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking. 
                                        Insight into the methods used in these crimes facilitates more efficient measures for prevention, detection, and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Criminal justice agencies must comply with various legal standards and regulations regarding data protection and privacy. 
                                        Non-compliance can lead to legal ramifications and harm to the institution's reputation. Course Outcome By a thorough examination of artificial intelligence's impact and implications, your

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.0: What is Privacy? Why is privacy Important in Criminal Justice? This section emphasize s the importance of being aware of cybersecurity threats in our daily lives. Not all threats are direct or overt; some come from subtle and subversive actors, including surveillance-based advertisers, governments, data miners, and even educational institutions. Computer privacy in the context of criminal justice studies refers to the protection of sensitive information in digital form, particularly as it relates to the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of those in the criminal justice field, including law enforcement, legal professionals, and correctional authorities. For criminal justice students, understanding computer privacy is critical for several reasons. Legal Requirements: Students must learn about the legal protections around digital data, such as laws against unauthorized access and misuse of computer systems, including the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Ethical Considerations: Ethical use of information technology in criminal justice involves respecting the privacy rights of individuals while balancing public safety needs. This includes the ethical handling of data obtained from computer systems, surveillance technology, and personal digital devices. Investigative Techniques: Students need to understand how to legally and ethically collect, analyze, and store digital evidence for use in criminal investigations and prosecutions. This includes knowledge of digital forensics and the legal standards required to present digital evidence in court. Privacy Policies: Students must be familiar with privacy policies that govern the use of technology in criminal justice settings. This includes understanding how data can be shared between agencies and with the public, and the implications of data breaches or misuse. Technological Impact: As technology evolves, so do the privacy concerns related to its use in criminal justice. Students must stay informed about current and emerging technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence, and their implications for privacy and civil liberties.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.1 What is Data Theft? Data theft occurs when information is collected and used without the knowledge or permission of the owner. This can include personal information, browsing habits, location data, and more. As individuals go about their day, various entities collect data on them. For example, when someone shops online, their browsing and purchasing history can be tracked. Similarly, social media platforms track interactions and preferences to tailor advertisements. Smartphones, which are less customizable than computers, often come with pre-installed potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and have enabled location services and Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) that track user activity and location. Surveillance-Based Advertisers and Governments (e.g., through laws like CALEA in the United States) are key players in data collection. Data Miners aggregate and analyze data for patterns, while Schools collect data on students for educational and administrative purposes. Risks Associated with Data Theft Data theft can lead to a wide range of risks and consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Understanding these risks is crucial for implementing effective security measures and privacy practices. Identity Theft: One of the most immediate and severe risks of personal data theft is identity theft. When thieves access personal information such as Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, or bank account details, they can impersonate victims to commit fraud, open new accounts in their name, or make unauthorized purchases. Financial Loss: Data theft can lead to direct financial loss. This can occur through unauthorized transactions, draining of bank accounts, or using stolen credit card information. Businesses may also face significant financial impacts due to theft of proprietary information or customer data, leading to loss of competitive advantage, regulatory fines, and compensation costs. Reputation Damage: For businesses, a data breach can severely damage their reputation, leading to lost customer trust and loyalty. For individuals, the exposure of personal or sensitive information can lead to embarrassment or reputational harm, especially if private photos, messages, or personal details are leaked. Legal and Regulatory Consequences: Data breaches often result in legal action from affected parties, as well as fines and sanctions from regulatory bodies. Organizations that fail to protect user data can face severe penalties under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. Emotional Stress and Privacy Invasion: Victims of data theft may experience significant emotional distress, feeling violated after their personal information is exposed or misused. The psychological impact, including stress, anxiety, and a sense of vulnerability, can be profound and long-lasting. Loss of Intellectual Property: For organizations, the theft of intellectual property, such as trade secrets, patents, and proprietary information, can have devastating effects on their competitive edge, innovation capacity, and market position. Operational Disruption: Data theft can lead to operational disruptions for businesses. If critical data is stolen or tampered with, operations can grind to a halt, leading to loss of productivity and potentially significant financial losses. Unintended Data Sharing and Cross-Pollination: Stolen data can be shared across different platforms and with unintended parties, leading to a loss of control over how personal or sensitive information is used or disseminated. Targeted Phishing Attacks: With access to personal information, cybercriminals can craft highly convincing phishing emails and messages, leading to further data breaches or financial theft. Perpetuation of Cybercrime: Data theft can fuel further criminal activities. Stolen data is often sold on the dark web, providing resources and funding for other cybercrimes, creating a cycle of theft and exploitation. Mitigating these risks involves a combination of strong cybersecurity measures, awareness and education, regulatory compliance, and proactive monitoring and response strategies. For individuals, practicing good data hygiene, such as using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious about sharing personal information online, can significantly reduce the risk of data theft. Watch the following video to see data theft by social engineering.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2 Introduction to Cryptology Cryptography is the practice of securing communications to prevent unauthorized access. It includes encryption (converting plaintext to ciphertext) and decryption (converting ciphertext back to plaintext). Cryptography, in the simplest terms, is the art of writing or solving codes. It's like the science of secret communication. Its purpose is to ensure privacy and security by transforming readable information, known as plaintext, into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext. This process, called encryption, helps protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Imagine you have a postcard that you want to send to a friend, but you don't want anyone else who might see the postcard along the way to read its message. Cryptography is like a special invisible ink that only you and your friend know how to make visible. You write your message with this ink, and to anyone else who sees the postcard, it appears blank. Only your friend, who knows the secret to make the ink visible again, can read the message. Cryptography doesn't just hide data; it can also verify that data hasn't been altered and confirm the identity of the sender and receiver. This is essential for tasks like securely accessing websites, signing digital documents, or even verifying that a software update comes from a legitimate source.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2.1 Benefits of Cryptology Confidentiality Privacy Protection: Cryptology ensures that information is kept confidential, allowing sensitive data like personal messages, financial information, and business secrets to be transmitted securely. Data Protection: By encrypting data, cryptology protects it from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read it. Integrity Data Integrity Verification: Cryptology provides mechanisms, such as digital signatures and hash functions, to verify that data has not been tampered with during transmission. This means recipients can be confident that the information they receive is exactly what the sender intended. Authentication Identity Verification: Through techniques like digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI), cryptology can confirm the identity of the parties involved in a communication. This helps prevent impersonation and fraud. Source Authentication: It ensures that the origin of a message or transaction can be reliably verified, important in financial transactions and secure communications. Non-repudiation Proof of Origin: Cryptology ensures that a sender cannot deny the authenticity of the message they sent, as digital signatures provide cryptographic proof of origin. This is crucial for legal and financial documents. Access Control Secure Access: Encryption can be used to restrict access to sensitive information, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or use it. This is essential for personal privacy and corporate security. Obfuscation Protection of Intellectual Property: By obfuscating code or data, cryptology helps protect intellectual property from being easily understood and misused by unauthorized parties. Secure Communication End-to-End Encryption: Cryptology enables secure communication channels over insecure networks, such as the internet, ensuring that messages remain private and secure from eavesdroppers. E-commerce Security Transaction Security: Cryptology is fundamental in securing online transactions, providing the backbone for protocols like SSL/TLS, which protect online shopping, banking, and more. Digital Certificates and Signatures Trust Establishment: By using digital certificates and signatures, cryptology helps establish trust between parties in digital environments, crucial for online business and government transactions. Regulatory Compliance Meeting Legal Standards: Cryptology helps organizations comply with privacy laws and regulations by providing the necessary tools to protect sensitive information.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2.2 Types of Cryptology Cryptology encompasses two primary disciplines: cryptography and cryptanalysis. Within these disciplines, there are various types and methods used to secure communications and break codes. 
                                    Cryptography is the practice of designing algorithms and systems for secure communication in the presence of third parties with potentially malicious intent. It involves creating methods 
                                    to encrypt and decrypt information, ensuring that data can be securely transmitted, stored, and accessed only by intended parties. Symmetric-Key Cryptography Definition: In symmetric-key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This key must be shared between the communicating parties in a secure manner. Use Case: Symmetric-key cryptography is fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large volumes of data or for use in systems where processing power is limited. Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard). Asymmetric-Key Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography) Definition: Asymmetric-key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, for encryption, and a private key, kept secret by the owner, for decryption. This solves the problem of key distribution that plagues symmetric-key cryptography. Use Case: It's widely used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data. Examples: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Watch the following video to learn more about RSA encryption. Hash Functions Definition: Hash functions take an input (or 'message') and return a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a digest that is unique to each unique input. They are designed to be one-way functions, making it infeasible to invert or find two different inputs that produce the same output. Use Case: Hash functions are used for integrity verification, password storage, and digital signatures. Examples: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), MD5 (though considered insecure for many purposes now).

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2.3 Cryptoanalysis Cryptanalysis is the art and science of analyzing and breaking cryptographic schemes. It's essentially the flip side of cryptography, focusing on uncovering weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms and finding methods to decrypt information without access to the secret key. Frequency Analysis Use: Primarily used against classical ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher, where the frequency of letters in a ciphertext is analyzed to deduce the likely plaintext. Known-Plaintext Attack Use: The attacker has access to both the plaintext (original message) and its corresponding ciphertext and attempts to derive the key used in the encryption process. Chosen-Plaintext Attack Use: The attacker can choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal is to exploit this capability to determine the key or uncover a weakness in the encryption algorithm. Differential Cryptanalysis Use: A more sophisticated method that involves studying how differences in the input to a cryptographic algorithm affect the resultant difference at the output. It's often used against block ciphers. Side-Channel Attacks Use: These attacks do not target the cryptographic algorithm directly but instead exploit physical implementations of the algorithm to extract key information. This can include timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, etc. Cryptology, through these types and techniques, forms the backbone of modern secure communication and data protection strategies. While cryptography focuses on building robust encryption methods, cryptanalysis plays the crucial role of testing and ensuring their security against potential attacks.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2.4 Protections Through Cryptology Security Measures for Data at Rest Data at Rest: Encrypting stored data to protect it from unauthorized access. Data at rest refers to data that is stored on a physical medium and is not actively being accessed or processed. It contrasts with data in transit, which is data being actively transferred from one location to another, and data in use, which is data being processed or accessed by applications. Data at rest can be found in various forms and on different types of storage devices, including hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, backup tapes, and cloud storage. The security of data at rest is crucial because it represents a static target for unauthorized access or theft. If an attacker can gain access to stored data, they can potentially extract sensitive information, such as personal details, financial records, intellectual property, or login credentials. This risk is especially significant for organizations that store large volumes of sensitive data. Encryption: This is the most effective way to protect the confidentiality of data at rest. By encrypting the data, it is rendered unreadable to anyone who does not have the decryption key. Even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage medium, the data will remain inaccessible without the key. Encryption can be applied at different levels, including individual files, entire databases, or full disks. Access Controls: Implementing strict access controls ensures that only authorized users and systems can access or modify the stored data. This includes setting up user permissions and roles within an organization's IT systems. Data Masking: For certain types of data, masking or anonymization can be used to protect sensitive information. This involves altering the data in a way that it remains usable for processing but cannot be traced back to any individual. Physical Security: Protecting the physical security of the devices or data centers where data is stored is essential. This can include measures such as locks, biometric security, security guards, and surveillance cameras. Regular Audits and Monitoring: Regular security audits and continuous monitoring of access logs can help identify and mitigate unauthorized access attempts or other security incidents involving data at rest. Data Lifecycle Management Implementing policies for the regular review, archiving, and secure deletion of data that is no longer needed can reduce the volume of data at risk and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Protecting data at rest is a fundamental aspect of information security and privacy practices. It helps prevent data breaches and the resulting financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences. As threats evolve and storage technologies change, the strategies and tools for securing data at rest also need to be continually updated and refined. Security Measures for Data in Transit Data in transit refers to any data that is being moved from one location to another across a network. This can include data being transferred over the internet, between devices in a local network, or through wireless connections such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Data in transit can be contrasted with data at rest, which is data that is not actively moving and is stored on a device or network, and data in use, which is data being processed or accessed by applications. The protection of data in transit is critical because, during transmission, data can be more vulnerable to interception, eavesdropping, or manipulation by unauthorized parties. If sensitive information such as personal details, financial transactions, or confidential communications is intercepted, it can lead to privacy violations, financial fraud, and other security breaches. Common risks to data in transit: Interception and Eavesdropping: Attackers may capture sensitive information as it travels across a network. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM): An attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. Replay Attacks: An attacker captures data in transit and retransmits it to attempt unauthorized access or execute a transaction. Security measures for Data in Transit: Encryption: Encrypting data before it is transmitted ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or used by unauthorized parties. Protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are commonly used to secure web traffic, while VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can secure data over untrusted networks. Secure Protocols: Using secure communication protocols like HTTPS (instead of HTTP), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), and SSH (Secure Shell) can provide encryption and secure authentication mechanisms. Authentication and Integrity Checks: Implementing strong authentication methods and integrity checks (such as digital signatures) ensures that the data is sent and received by the intended parties without being tampered with. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs create a secure, encrypted tunnel for data to travel through, which can protect the data from eavesdropping and interception over untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): Ensuring that data is encrypted from the sender to the recipient without intermediary decryption. Securing data in transit is a fundamental aspect of network security and privacy protection. It involves a combination of technologies, protocols, and best practices designed to ensure that data remains confidential and intact from its point of origin to its destination. As cyber threats evolve, maintaining high standards of security for data in transit remains a constant challenge for individuals and organizations alike.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Privacy 4.2.5 End-to-End Encryption End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication that prevents third parties from accessing data while it's transferred from one end system or device to another. In E2EE, the data is encrypted on the sender's system or device and only the recipient can decrypt it. Nobody in between, be it internet service providers, hackers, or even the platform provider itself, can read or access the decrypted data. How End-to-End Encryption Works Disconnecting devices can significantly reduce the risk of ransomware infection. Encryption: The process begins when a message is encrypted at the sender's device. The message is transformed into a scrambled format using an encryption algorithm and a key. This ensures that the content is unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient. Transmission: The encrypted data is then transmitted across the internet or any other network. Despite the data passing through various servers and nodes, it remains encrypted and inaccessible to others. Decryption: Once the encrypted data reaches the recipient's device, it is decrypted using a corresponding decryption key. The recipient can now read the original message. Key Characteristics Keys: E2EE typically uses a pair of cryptographic keys, a public key, and a private key, in what is known as asymmetric encryption. The public key is used to encrypt the message, and the private key is used to decrypt it. The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be distributed widely. Security: Because the decryption key is only held by the recipient, E2EE provides a high level of security. It ensures that the data remains confidential between the communicating users. Privacy: E2EE is a crucial tool for protecting privacy in digital communications, as it prevents potential eavesdroppers from accessing the contents of the communication, including service providers themselves. Applications of End-to-End Encryption Messaging Apps: Many modern messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, use E2EE to secure messages between users. Email Encryption: Services like ProtonMail offer E2EE for email, ensuring that only the sender and the recipient can read the contents of an email. File Storage and Sharing: Some cloud storage services use E2EE to protect files, photos, and documents stored and shared through their platforms. Video and Voice Calls: Encrypted video and voice calling features are increasingly common, providing secure, private communication channels. Challenges and Considerations While E2EE is a powerful tool for privacy and security, it also presents challenges: Key Management The security of E2EE depends on the proper management of encryption keys. If a private key is lost, the data encrypted with the corresponding public key cannot be decrypted. Legal and Regulatory Issues Governments and law enforcement agencies have raised concerns that E2EE can obstruct legal investigations. This has led to debates about creating backdoors or ways to bypass encryption, which security experts argue would undermine the security and privacy benefits of E2EE. User Experience Implementing E2EE can sometimes make services less user-friendly. For example, recovering data without the private key becomes impossible, which could lead to data loss if users lose their keys and haven't backed them up.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice 4.3: Understanding Cookies Imagine you're visiting a friend's house for the first time. When you arrive, they give you a small, unique sticker to put on your shirt. This sticker has a number on it that doesn't mean much to you, but to your friend, it tells them how many times you've visited, what your favorite snacks are, and where you like to sit. The next time you visit, they see your sticker right away, remember all those details, and can make your visit more comfortable and enjoyable based on what they know about you. In the digital world, when you visit a website, it can give your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) a small piece of data called a "cookie." This cookie acts like the sticker in our analogy. It helps the website remember information about your visit, making your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Types of Cookies Session Cookies: These are temporary cookies that are used to remember you during your visit to a website. They store information used to maintain your browsing session, such as your login status or what you've put in a shopping cart. When you close your browser, session cookies are deleted. Persistent Cookies: Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies stay on your browser for a set period, even after you've left the site. They remember your preferences and actions across a site (or sometimes across different sites) to make your future visits more convenient. For example, a website might use a persistent cookie to remember your language preference. First-party Cookies: These are set by the website you're visiting directly. They help the site remember things like your login status, language preferences, and other settings. Third-party Cookies: These are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. They're often used for online advertising purposes. For instance, an advertiser might use third-party cookies to track your visits across multiple websites to show you targeted ads based on your browsing history. 4.3.1: Why Cookies Matter Cookies play a crucial role in making the web experience smooth and more personalized. They can: Improve Website Functionality: Cookies allow websites to remember your settings (like preferences, login status) so you don't have to re-enter information every time you visit a site. Analyze Website Usage: Websites use cookies to understand how users interact with their pages, which helps them improve content and functionality. Personalize Advertising: Advertisers use cookies to collect information about your browsing habits, allowing them to show you ads that are more relevant to your interests. Privacy Concerns While cookies enhance browsing, they also raise privacy concerns because they track your behavior across the web. This tracking is why you might see ads for a product you looked at on one site appear on another site. Due to these concerns, laws and regulations now require websites to get your consent before they can store cookies on your browser, giving you more control over your online privacy. Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) are unique, resettable identifiers assigned to your mobile device or tablet by its operating system—iOS (Apple) assigns the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), and Android assigns the Google Advertising ID (AAID). These identifiers allow app developers and advertisers to track your activity across apps and websites for advertising purposes, like cookies in web browsers but for mobile environments. Disabling or resetting these IDs can enhance your privacy by making it more difficult for companies to collect and share data about your online behaviors.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 4: Case Study Carpenter v. United States (2018) Background The case of Carpenter v. United States (2018) set a significant precedent in the realm of digital privacy and Fourth Amendment protections. The Supreme Court ruled that the government must obtain a warrant before accessing an individual's cellphone location data, marking a pivotal shift in privacy law as it applies to the digital age. Scenario In 2011, Timothy Carpenter was implicated in a series of armed robberies. To build their case, the FBI obtained Carpenter's cellphone location data from his wireless carriers without a warrant. This data included 127 days' worth of Carpenter's movements, which the FBI used to place him near the crime scenes. Carpenter argued that this was a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. Supreme Court Ruling In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of Carpenter, stating that accessing historical cellphone location data without a warrant constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice 4.1: Introduction to Privacy This section emphasizes the importance of being aware of cybersecurity threats in our daily lives. Not all threats are direct or overt; some come from subtle and subversive actors, including surveillance-based advertisers, governments, data miners, and even educational institutions. Computer privacy in the context of criminal justice studies refers to the protection of sensitive information in digital form, particularly as it relates to the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of those in the criminal justice field, including law enforcement, legal professionals, and correctional authorities. For criminal justice students, understanding computer privacy is critical for several reasons. Why is privacy Important in Criminal Justice? Legal Requirements: Students must learn about the legal protections around digital data, such as laws against unauthorized access and misuse of computer systems, including the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Ethical Considerations: Ethical use of information technology in criminal justice involves respecting the privacy rights of individuals while balancing public safety needs. This includes the ethical handling of data obtained from computer systems, surveillance technology, and personal digital devices. Investigative Techniques: Students need to understand how to legally and ethically collect, analyze, and store digital evidence for use in criminal investigations and prosecutions. This includes knowledge of digital forensics and the legal standards required to present digital evidence in court. Privacy Policies: Students must be familiar with privacy policies that govern the use of technology in criminal justice settings. This includes understanding how data can be shared between agencies and with the public, and the implications of data breaches or misuse. Technological Impact: As technology evolves, so do the privacy concerns related to its use in criminal justice. Students must stay informed about current and emerging technologies, such as biometrics, facial recognition, and artificial intelligence, and their implications for privacy and civil liberties.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice 4.2 What is Data Theft? Data theft occurs when information is collected and used without the knowledge or permission of the owner. This can include personal information, browsing habits, location data, and more. As individuals go about their day, various entities collect data on them. For example, when someone shops online, their browsing and purchasing history can be tracked. Similarly, social media platforms track interactions and preferences to tailor advertisements. Smartphones, which are less customizable than computers, often come with pre-installed potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) and have enabled location services and Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) that track user activity and location. Surveillance-Based Advertisers and Governments (e.g., through laws like CALEA in the United States) are key players in data collection. Data Miners aggregate and analyze data for patterns, while Schools collect data on students for educational and administrative purposes. External Resource Link: CALEA Risks Associated with Data Theft: Data theft can lead to a wide range of risks and consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Understanding these risks is crucial for implementing effective security measures and privacy practices. Identity Theft: One of the most immediate and severe risks of personal data theft is identity theft. When thieves access personal information such as Social Security numbers, driver’s licenses, or bank account details, they can impersonate victims to commit fraud, open new accounts in their name, or make unauthorized purchases. Financial Loss: Data theft can lead to direct financial loss. This can occur through unauthorized transactions, draining of bank accounts, or using stolen credit card information. Businesses may also face significant financial impacts due to theft of proprietary information or customer data, leading to loss of competitive advantage, regulatory fines, and compensation costs. Reputation Damage: For businesses, a data breach can severely damage their reputation, leading to lost customer trust and loyalty. For individuals, the exposure of personal or sensitive information can lead to embarrassment or reputational harm, especially if private photos, messages, or personal details are leaked. Legal and Regulatory Consequences: Data breaches often result in legal action from affected parties, as well as fines and sanctions from regulatory bodies. Organizations that fail to protect user data can face severe penalties under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. Emotional Stress and Privacy Invasion: Victims of data theft may experience significant emotional distress, feeling violated after their personal information is exposed or misused. The psychological impact, including stress, anxiety, and a sense of vulnerability, can be profound and long-lasting. Loss of Intellectual Property: For organizations, the theft of intellectual property, such as trade secrets, patents, and proprietary information, can have devastating effects on their competitive edge, innovation capacity, and market position. Operational Disruption: Data theft can lead to operational disruptions for businesses. If critical data is stolen or tampered with, operations can grind to a halt, leading to loss of productivity and potentially significant financial losses. Unintended Data Sharing and Cross-Pollination: Stolen data can be shared across different platforms and with unintended parties, leading to a loss of control over how personal or sensitive information is used or disseminated. Targeted Phishing Attacks: With access to personal information, cybercriminals can craft highly convincing phishing emails and messages, leading to further data breaches or financial theft. Perpetuation of Cybercrime: Data theft can fuel further criminal activities. Stolen data is often sold on the dark web, providing resources and funding for other cybercrimes, creating a cycle of theft and exploitation. Mitigating these risks involves a combination of strong cybersecurity measures, awareness and education, regulatory compliance, and proactive monitoring and response strategies. For individuals, practicing good data hygiene, such as using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious about sharing personal information online, can significantly reduce the risk of data theft.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice 4.3 Introduction to Cryptology Cryptography is the practice of securing communications to prevent unauthorized access. It includes encryption (converting plaintext to ciphertext) and decryption (converting ciphertext back to plaintext). Cryptography, in the simplest terms, is the art of writing or solving codes. It's like the science of secret communication. Its purpose is to ensure privacy and security by transforming readable information, known as plaintext, into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext. This process, called encryption, helps protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Imagine you have a postcard that you want to send to a friend, but you don't want anyone else who might see the postcard along the way to read its message. Cryptography is like a special invisible ink that only you and your friend know how to make visible. You write your message with this ink, and to anyone else who sees the postcard, it appears blank. Only your friend, who knows the secret to make the ink visible again, can read the message. Cryptography doesn't just hide data; it can also verify that data hasn't been altered and confirm the identity of the sender and receiver. This is essential for tasks like securely accessing websites, signing digital documents, or even verifying that a software update comes from a legitimate source. 4.3.1 Benefits of Cryptology Confidentiality Privacy Protection: Cryptology ensures that information is kept confidential, allowing sensitive data like personal messages, financial information, and business secrets to be transmitted securely. Data Protection: By encrypting data, cryptology protects it from unauthorized access, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read it. Integrity Data Integrity Verification: Cryptology provides mechanisms, such as digital signatures and hash functions, to verify that data has not been tampered with during transmission. This means recipients can be confident that the information they receive is exactly what the sender intended. Authentication Identity Verification: Through techniques like digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI), cryptology can confirm the identity of the parties involved in a communication. This helps prevent impersonation and fraud. Source Authentication: It ensures that the origin of a message or transaction can be reliably verified, important in financial transactions and secure communications. Non-repudiation Proof of Origin: Cryptology ensures that a sender cannot deny the authenticity of the message they sent, as digital signatures provide cryptographic proof of origin. This is crucial for legal and financial documents. Access Control Secure Access: Encryption can be used to restrict access to sensitive information, ensuring that only authorized individuals can view or use it. This is essential for personal privacy and corporate security. Obfuscation Protection of Intellectual Property: By obfuscating code or data, cryptology helps protect intellectual property from being easily understood and misused by unauthorized parties. Secure Communication End-to-End Encryption: Cryptology enables secure communication channels over insecure networks, such as the internet, ensuring that messages remain private and secure from eavesdroppers. E-commerce Security Transaction Security: Cryptology is fundamental in securing online transactions, providing the backbone for protocols like SSL/TLS, which protect online shopping, banking, and more. Digital Certificates and Signatures Trust Establishment: By using digital certificates and signatures, cryptology helps establish trust between parties in digital environments, crucial for online business and government transactions. Regulatory Compliance Meeting Legal Standards: Cryptology helps organizations comply with privacy laws and regulations by providing the necessary tools to protect sensitive information. 4.3.2 Types of Cryptology Cryptology encompasses two primary disciplines: cryptography and cryptanalysis. Within these disciplines, there are various types and methods used to secure communications and break codes. 
                                    Cryptography is the practice of designing algorithms and systems for secure communication in the presence of third parties with potentially malicious intent. It involves creating methods 
                                    to encrypt and decrypt information, ensuring that data can be securely transmitted, stored, and accessed only by intended parties. Symmetric-Key Cryptography Definition: In symmetric-key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This key must be shared between the communicating parties in a secure manner. Use Case: Symmetric-key cryptography is fast and efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large volumes of data or for use in systems where processing power is limited. Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard). Asymmetric-Key Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography) Definition: Asymmetric-key cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared openly, for encryption, and a private key, kept secret by the owner, for decryption. This solves the problem of key distribution that plagues symmetric-key cryptography. Use Case: It's widely used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data. Examples: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Hash Functions Definition: Hash functions take an input (or 'message') and return a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a digest that is unique to each unique input. They are designed to be one-way functions, making it infeasible to invert or find two different inputs that produce the same output. Use Case: Hash functions are used for integrity verification, password storage, and digital signatures. Examples: SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), MD5 (though considered insecure for many purposes now). Instructional Resources: For Windows users, updates can be managed and reviewed at the Windows Update page For MacOS users, guidance on updates is available at th MacOS Update Guide 4.3.3 Cryptoanalysis Cryptanalysis is the art and science of analyzing and breaking cryptographic schemes. It's essentially the flip side of cryptography, focusing on uncovering weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms and finding methods to decrypt information without access to the secret key. Frequency Analysis Use: Primarily used against classical ciphers, such as the Caesar cipher, where the frequency of letters in a ciphertext is analyzed to deduce the likely plaintext. Known-Plaintext Attack Use: The attacker has access to both the plaintext (original message) and its corresponding ciphertext and attempts to derive the key used in the encryption process. Chosen-Plaintext Attack Use: The attacker can choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal is to exploit this capability to determine the key or uncover a weakness in the encryption algorithm. Differential Cryptanalysis Use: A more sophisticated method that involves studying how differences in the input to a cryptographic algorithm affect the resultant difference at the output. It's often used against block ciphers. Side-Channel Attacks Use: These attacks do not target the cryptographic algorithm directly but instead exploit physical implementations of the algorithm to extract key information. This can include timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, etc. Cryptology, through these types and techniques, forms the backbone of modern secure communication and data protection strategies. While cryptography focuses on building robust encryption methods, cryptanalysis plays the crucial role of testing and ensuring their security against potential attacks. 4.3.4 Protections Through Cryptology Security Measures for Data at Rest Data at Rest: Encrypting stored data to protect it from unauthorized access. Data at rest refers to data that is stored on a physical medium and is not actively being accessed or processed. It contrasts with data in transit, which is data being actively transferred from one location to another, and data in use, which is data being processed or accessed by applications. Data at rest can be found in various forms and on different types of storage devices, including hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, backup tapes, and cloud storage. The security of data at rest is crucial because it represents a static target for unauthorized access or theft. If an attacker can gain access to stored data, they can potentially extract sensitive information, such as personal details, financial records, intellectual property, or login credentials. This risk is especially significant for organizations that store large volumes of sensitive data. Encryption: This is the most effective way to protect the confidentiality of data at rest. By encrypting the data, it is rendered unreadable to anyone who does not have the decryption key. Even if an attacker gains physical access to the storage medium, the data will remain inaccessible without the key. Encryption can be applied at different levels, including individual files, entire databases, or full disks. Access Controls: Implementing strict access controls ensures that only authorized users and systems can access or modify the stored data. This includes setting up user permissions and roles within an organization's IT systems. Data Masking: For certain types of data, masking or anonymization can be used to protect sensitive information. This involves altering the data in a way that it remains usable for processing but cannot be traced back to any individual. Physical Security: Protecting the physical security of the devices or data centers where data is stored is essential. This can include measures such as locks, biometric security, security guards, and surveillance cameras. Regular Audits and Monitoring: Regular security audits and continuous monitoring of access logs can help identify and mitigate unauthorized access attempts or other security incidents involving data at rest. Data Lifecycle Management Implementing policies for the regular review, archiving, and secure deletion of data that is no longer needed can reduce the volume of data at risk and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Protecting data at rest is a fundamental aspect of information security and privacy practices. It helps prevent data breaches and the resulting financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences. As threats evolve and storage technologies change, the strategies and tools for securing data at rest also need to be continually updated and refined. Security Measures for Data in Transit Data in transit refers to any data that is being moved from one location to another across a network. This can include data being transferred over the internet, between devices in a local network, or through wireless connections such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Data in transit can be contrasted with data at rest, which is data that is not actively moving and is stored on a device or network, and data in use, which is data being processed or accessed by applications. The protection of data in transit is critical because, during transmission, data can be more vulnerable to interception, eavesdropping, or manipulation by unauthorized parties. If sensitive information such as personal details, financial transactions, or confidential communications is intercepted, it can lead to privacy violations, financial fraud, and other security breaches. Common risks to data in transit: Interception and Eavesdropping: Attackers may capture sensitive information as it travels across a network. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM): An attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. Replay Attacks: An attacker captures data in transit and retransmits it to attempt unauthorized access or execute a transaction. Security measures for Data in Transit: Encryption: Encrypting data before it is transmitted ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or used by unauthorized parties. Protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are commonly used to secure web traffic, while VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can secure data over untrusted networks. Secure Protocols: Using secure communication protocols like HTTPS (instead of HTTP), SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), and SSH (Secure Shell) can provide encryption and secure authentication mechanisms. Authentication and Integrity Checks: Implementing strong authentication methods and integrity checks (such as digital signatures) ensures that the data is sent and received by the intended parties without being tampered with. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs create a secure, encrypted tunnel for data to travel through, which can protect the data from eavesdropping and interception over untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi. End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): Ensuring that data is encrypted from the sender to the recipient without intermediary decryption. Securing data in transit is a fundamental aspect of network security and privacy protection. It involves a combination of technologies, protocols, and best practices designed to ensure that data remains confidential and intact from its point of origin to its destination. As cyber threats evolve, maintaining high standards of security for data in transit remains a constant challenge for individuals and organizations alike. 4.3.5 End-to-End Encryption End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a method of secure communication that prevents third parties from accessing data while it's transferred from one end system or device to another. In E2EE, the data is encrypted on the sender's system or device and only the recipient can decrypt it. Nobody in between, be it internet service providers, hackers, or even the platform provider itself, can read or access the decrypted data. How End-to-End Encryption Works Disconnecting devices can significantly reduce the risk of ransomware infection. Encryption: The process begins when a message is encrypted at the sender's device. The message is transformed into a scrambled format using an encryption algorithm and a key. This ensures that the content is unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient. Transmission: The encrypted data is then transmitted across the internet or any other network. Despite the data passing through various servers and nodes, it remains encrypted and inaccessible to others. Decryption: Once the encrypted data reaches the recipient's device, it is decrypted using a corresponding decryption key. The recipient can now read the original message. Key Characteristics Keys: E2EE typically uses a pair of cryptographic keys, a public key, and a private key, in what is known as asymmetric encryption. The public key is used to encrypt the message, and the private key is used to decrypt it. The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be distributed widely. Security: Because the decryption key is only held by the recipient, E2EE provides a high level of security. It ensures that the data remains confidential between the communicating users. Privacy: E2EE is a crucial tool for protecting privacy in digital communications, as it prevents potential eavesdroppers from accessing the contents of the communication, including service providers themselves. Applications of End-to-End Encryption Messaging Apps: Many modern messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, use E2EE to secure messages between users. Email Encryption: Services like ProtonMail offer E2EE for email, ensuring that only the sender and the recipient can read the contents of an email. File Storage and Sharing: Some cloud storage services use E2EE to protect files, photos, and documents stored and shared through their platforms. Video and Voice Calls: Encrypted video and voice calling features are increasingly common, providing secure, private communication channels. Challenges and Considerations While E2EE is a powerful tool for privacy and security, it also presents challenges: Key Management The security of E2EE depends on the proper management of encryption keys. If a private key is lost, the data encrypted with the corresponding public key cannot be decrypted. Legal and Regulatory Issues Governments and law enforcement agencies have raised concerns that E2EE can obstruct legal investigations. This has led to debates about creating backdoors or ways to bypass encryption, which security experts argue would undermine the security and privacy benefits of E2EE. User Experience Implementing E2EE can sometimes make services less user-friendly. For example, recovering data without the private key becomes impossible, which could lead to data loss if users lose their keys and haven't backed them up.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 2: Computer Security 2.0 What is Computer Security? Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                                    This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                                    and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Knowledge of computer security can enhance your ability to investigate cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking. 
                                        Insight into the methods used in these crimes facilitates more efficient measures for prevention, detection, and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Criminal justice agencies must comply with various legal standards and regulations regarding data protection and privacy. 
                                        Non-compliance can lead to legal ramifications and harm to the institution's reputation. 2.1 What is Malware? Malware is software that enters your computer system, without your knowledge, and carries out unwanted actions.
                                    Often, these actions damage, disrupt, or steal data on your computer; but they can even include planting a foothold for future access to your computer.
                                    If we think of your computer as a fortress, holding and protecting all of your valuable goods and information, then we can view malware as any type of non-human invader 
                                    that is trying to control access to those valuables. As there are many types of malware, it can be difficult to categorize them. 
                                    So, a common practice is to categorize them based on their primary action.
                                    These can be broken down into: Kidnap Data Eavesdrop Masquerade Serve as Launchpad Sidestep External Resource Link: Cybersecurity & infrastructure Security Agency Malware Tip Card Malware Primary Actions Kidnap Data: This type of malware specifically targets and restricts access to critical data, systems, or devices. 
                                    The predominant form, ransomware, encrypts essential files and systems, demanding payment for decryption keys. 
                                    Such attacks can cripple the operational capabilities of law enforcement departments, courts, corrections facilities, and legal firms, 
                                    resulting in substantial operational disruptions and significant financial losses. Eavesdrop: Eavesdropping malware captures and transmits user data without consent. 
                                    Examples include keyloggers that record keystrokes, spyware that monitors user activities, and other software that can access device cameras and microphones. 
                                    These tools are used for stealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and personal identification information. Masquerade: This category includes malware that impersonates legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it under false pretenses. 
                                    Once operational, it executes malicious activities that can compromise legal investigations and sensitive data. 
                                    Specifically, criminal justice professionals should be wary of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Trojans. 
                                    These often come bundled with legitimate software or misrepresent their functionality, posing significant risks to the integrity of criminal justice systems and operations. Serve as Launchpad: Launchpad malware hijacks infected devices to initiate additional cyberattacks. 
                                    This includes viruses and worms that autonomously replicate and circulate across multiple systems, as well as bots that integrate into botnets. 
                                    These botnets are orchestrated to execute coordinated large-scale assaults such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, 
                                    which can severely compromise public safety and justice processes. Sidestep Security: This type of malware is strategically crafted to circumvent or neutralize security protocols. 
                                    Techniques include deploying rootkits to obscure the presence of malicious software, implementing backdoors to gain unauthorized access, 
                                    and programming logic bombs that execute harmful functions under specific conditions. 
                                    Such tactics pose significant threats to the integrity of criminal justice data and the secure operation of related information systems. 2.1.1 Data Kidnapping Data kidnapping mostly consists of Ransomware and Cryptomalware: Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer by locking the system. 
                                    It often demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. 
                                    Variants of ransomware may display deceitful messages claiming to be from law enforcement or software vendors, 
                                    alleging illegal activities or expired licenses to justify the lockdown. 
                                    This tactic can be particularly confusing and alarming for professionals in criminal justice, as it mimics legitimate legal authorities. 
                                    The ransomware may skip pretenses and straightforwardly demand payment to unlock the device. 
                                    Robust backup solutions and anti-malware systems are crucial for law enforcement agencies to mitigate the risk of such attacks. Cryptomalware: As a more severe form of ransomware, Cryptomalware encrypts all accessible files, rendering them inaccessible without a decryption key. 
                                    It may threaten to increase the ransom amount with each passing hour or day, adding urgency to its demands. 
                                    Newer variants are capable of spreading across network-connected devices, potentially crippling entire criminal justice systems. 
                                    Learning to recognize and avoid phishing attempts, which often distribute cryptomalware, is essential for protecting sensitive data and operational integrity. 2.1.2 Eavesdropping Eavesdropping mostly consists of Keyloggers and Spyware: Keyloggers: Keyloggers are tools that capture and store every keystroke made on a computer. 
                                    They can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), 
                                    posing a significant threat to privacy and security. Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based. 
                                    Software-based keyloggers are capable of taking screenshots and activating web cameras to capture images of the user.  
                                    They do not require physical access to be installed and can transmit captured data through the network. 
                                    Conversely, hardware-based keyloggers are usually small USB devices that are connected between a keyboard and computer, 
                                    typically in public locations where they are easier to install and retrieve later. 
                                    As they are external to the computer's operating system, they cannot be detected by standard antimalware software. Spyware: Spyware is malicious software that gathers information from a user's computer without their knowledge and sends it to third parties. 
                                    It can come in the form of automatic download software that self-installs without user interaction, potentially resulting in the installation of unauthorized software.
                                    Other forms include passive tracking technologies that collect data on user activities, system modifying software that changes user settings without permission, 
                                    and tracking software that monitors user behavior and collects data such as PII, increasing the risk of fraud and identity theft. 
                                    These aspects make spyware particularly dangerous for professionals in the criminal justice field, 
                                    where confidentiality and integrity of information are of the utmost importance. 2.1.3 Masquerading Masquerading mostly consists of Potentially Unwanted Programs, Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs): PUPs are applications that may be unwanted, despite often being bundled with software that users download and install. 
                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data. 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources. 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used of bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge. 
                                    In the criminal justice field, such vulnerabilities could be exploited to access confidential data, including case files and personal information. 
                                    Initially, developers may create backdoors for legitimate purposes such as maintenance. 
                                    However, if not removed, they pose a significant security risk as they can be discovered and used maliciously. Logic Bombs: Logic bombs are pieces of code that have been inserted into software and are designed to execute under specific conditions, 
                                    such as a specific time or when a certain action is performed. 
                                    For example, a logic bomb could be set to execute its attack three months after an employee left the firm, or after the 45th email sent by a clerk.
                                    A logic bomb could potentially be used to destroy data, disrupt system operations, or corrupt essential legal documents. 
                                    These are often hard to detect and can be planted by insiders who are trusted with access to sensitive systems. Rootkits: Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware in a system by intercepting and altering standard operating system processes. 
                                    Deeply embedded within the operating system, they are extremely difficult to detect and can give attackers full control of the system without the user's knowledge. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, rootkits represent a serious threat as they can be used to manipulate operations, 
                                    alter data, or steal information without detection for long periods. 2.1 Quiz 2.2 Defending Against Malware As criminal justice professionals, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of your computer systems is paramount. 
                                    Malware poses a significant threat to your data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or even disruption of your essential services.

                                        Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware. Antivirus and Anti-malware Software: Using antivirus and anti-malware programs provides a critical first line of defense, actively scanning and removing threats before they can cause harm. Monitor Firewalls: Configuring firewalls to control incoming and outgoing network traffic can prevent malicious activities and block unauthorized access Training and Awareness: Regular training sessions for all employees can help recognize phishing attempts and suspicious links, which are common vectors for malware. Backup and Recovery Plans: Maintaining regular backups of important data ensures that you can restore your system to a clean state in case of a malware attack, minimizing downtime and data loss. 2.2.1 Security Updates Regularly Updating software and security is a crucial to maintaining a proper cybersecurity posture. 
                                    It requires the systematic updating of software on computers to protect against vulnerabilities. Automatic Updates: Both Windows and macOS operating systems feature built-in mechanisms that regularly check for software updates over the internet. 
                                        These services ensure that your computer system is always equipped with the latest security features and fixes. Update Services: For a computer to receive these updates, it must be configured to interact with the vendor's update service. 
                                        This ensures that any patches released by the vendor are automatically applied to your system. Security Patches: Often referred to simply as patches, these updates target specific vulnerabilities within the system. 
                                        By addressing these vulnerabilities, patches play a critical role in fortifying the system against potential exploits and malware infections. Instructional Resources: For Windows users, updates can be managed and reviewed at the Windows Update page For MacOS users, guidance on updates is available at th MacOS Update Guide 2.2.2 Antimalware Software Antimalware and antivirus software are essential tools designed to protect computers and networks from malware. 
                                    These security programs scan, detect, and remove threats by monitoring system activity and checking files against databases of known malware signatures. 
                                    They also employ heuristic and behavior-based detection methods to identify unknown malware based on suspicious behavior. 
                                    Additionally, these tools provide real-time protection by blocking potentially harmful programs and files before they can cause damage, 
                                    ensuring that digital environments remain secure and operational. Antivirus Software Antivirus software is designed to: Scan and Monitor: It continuously scans the computer and monitors activities to identify potential threats. Examine Files: New documents are inspected when they are opened, created, or closed to detect any signs of infection Virus Detection: Uses a scanning engine and a database of known virus signatures to detect infections. 
                                        Keeping the signature file updated is crucial as outdated signatures can lead to security breaches. Response Actions: Upon detecting a virus, the software can remove the virus, quarantine the infected file, or delete the file outright. Limitations: While antivirus software provides a valid means of security, it should not be seen as a comprehensive solution to all security threats. Comprehensive Antimalware Software Beyond basic antivirus functions, comprehensive antimalware includes: Intrusion Prevention: Analyzes incoming data from the network, actively blocking potential threats before they enter the computer. Reputation Protection: Classifies software and files as “dangerous,” “risky,” or “safe” based on information gathered from a global network, enhancing proactive security measures. Behavioral Protection: Watches for unusual behavior in software and automatically intervenes to block potentially malicious activities. Built-in Antimalware Both Windows and MacOS provide built-in antimalware solutions: Windows: Microsoft Defender Antivirus offers integrated security right out of the box. MacOS Apple XProtect provides a basic level of protection against malware. Compatibility Warning: When considering third-party antimalware software, it's important to ensure there are no conflicts between it and built-in systems. 
                                        Always verify compatibility to avoid potential security gaps or performance issues. 2.2.3 Firewalls Monitoring and managing firewalls is a vital component of a proper cybersecurity posture, 
                                    particularly for safeguarding the networks and computers used in sensitive sectors like criminal justice. 
                                    Firewalls act as the first line of defense, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
                                    This includes not only blocking unauthorized access but also managing data packets that might carry potential threats. 
                                    Effective firewall management involves regular updates and audits to ensure that all security protocols are up to date and functioning as intended. Personal Firewalls Function: Personal firewalls act as packet filters that control the traffic entering or exiting a personal computer. Application Firewalls: These These are typically pre-installed on modern operating systems and are designed to allow traffic through only for specific, approved programs. 
                                        This helps to prevent an infected computer from spreading malware to other machines. Traffic Control: By default, these firewalls block all inbound traffic unless it has been explicitly allowed, while generally permitting outbound traffic unless specifically blocked. Network Firewalls Hardware-Based: Network firewalls are usually hardware devices placed at the edge of a network. Scope: They are designed to protect the entire network by inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic to decide whether to deny or allow it.

                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data. 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources. 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used of bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity 1.0: Cybersecurity is Ongoing Everything we do these days is online. You would think we could download antivirus 
                                    software by now and have protection covered, right? Unfortunately, the reality is 
                                    not that simple. As quickly as protections are developed, new vulnerabilities are 
                                    exposed. No single product guarantees online security. Instead, cybersecurity is an ongoing balancing act. Technologies emerge and new vulnerabilities 
                                    are discovered. Those vulnerabilities are addressed, and as attacker tools improve, 
                                    more risks arise. Cybersecurity professionals are constantly identifying and 
                                    reacting to new threats. As you can see below, A SINGLE ATTACK hit 1.3 billion
                                    targets. That's more than 1 in 8 people impacted globally by one threat actor! Click
                                    the image to see the full interactive version from Information is Beautiful. The scale of cyber threats is massive. The stakes are high, and the consequences of a breach can be catastrophic. 
                                    That's why cybersecurity is a critical field that requires constant vigilance and innovation to stay ahead of the threats. Challenges of Cybersecurity These are a few of the reasons why cybersecurity is tough to implement: Devices are universally connected: Attackers can come from anywhere across the globe. Technology keeps improving: Attackers can now launch attacks against millions of computers within minutes. 
                                        Vast networks of attacker-controlled computers can easily overwhelm targets. Attack tools are also improving: Attack software is available to novices and pros alike. 
                                        Attack tools can vary their behavior, so the same attack looks different each time. Vendors can't keep up: Vulnerabilities are detected quickly with these sophisticated tools. 
                                        Vendors are overwhelmed trying to keep up with updating products, and security updates are challenging to implement in a timely fashion. User confusion: Users are forced to make difficult security decisions with little instruction. 1.1 What is Information Security? Just as we protect our homes against burglars with a security system, we also protect our personal information against threats (such as identity theft!). 
                                    Information security is the practice of protecting information with value for people and organizations. 
                                    As data is transmitted, processed and stored, it must be protected. CIA: The Three Protections Confidentiality Confidentiality Only authorized parties should be able to view the information (example: credit card information). Integrity Integrity Information should be free from tampering (example: amount of purchase). Availability Availability The right people need to be able to access data as needed (example: security not so complex that merchant can’t access order information). AAA: Three Considerations Authentication Authentication Ensures user is not an impostor (example: 2FA to log on) Authorization Authorization Permission to use technology resources (example: clerk allowed to see order history for customer) Accounting Accounting Tracks events (example: who accessed server when) Information security consists of three layers: Products, People and Policy Products: From door locks to sophisticated firewalls, physical products protect information. People: The folks who implement and properly use security products. Policy: Established by organizations so people correctly use security products. 1.2: Terminology Terminology: Here's a quick rundown of basic cybersecurity jargon. We will use these terms to discuss attacks and defenses. Threat: action that could cause harm. Asset: item with value (information in our case!). Vulnerability: weakness in security. Risk: exposure to danger. Threat agent: person who could carry out the threat. Attack vector: how the attack could occur. Risks: Risks have their own associated vocabulary. Risk avoidance: avoid the risk in the first place, such as not storing information that could be stolen. Risk acceptance: accept there's a risk and do nothing. Risk deterrence: deter threat actors by advertising measures such as warnings and legal actions. Risk mitigation: make the risk less serious, such as by storing information in separate locations. Risk transference: hand the risk to someone else, such as by buying insurance. 1.3: Attacks and Defenses Attacks and attackers come in many forms: Attackers: Cybercriminals: seek fortune, not fame. Script kiddies: in it for thrills and notoriety. Brokers: sell vulnerabilities to highest bidder. Insiders: retaliate against own organization. Cyberterrorists: seek to cause pani. Hacktivists: think they are righting wrongs. State attackers: spy on and disrupt governments and citizens. Attacks: Point-of-sale (POS) attacks, where “memory scrapers” steal card information at time of transaction. Keyless entry system attacks, where threat actors amplify the signal of remote keys inside homes and gain access to vehicles parked outside. Home wireless network attacks, launching malicious software on home networks through a vulnerability found in 90 major manufacturers' products. Healthcare breaches are a huge problem and have even shut down hospitals entirely. Defenses: Block attacks: A strong security perimeter will protect you. Firewalls, VPNs, strong passwords, and even simple locks on doors can keep your information safer. Update defenses: Always keep hardware and software updated and install operating system security updates as soon as possible to protect against known threats. Minimize losses: Keep backup copies of data and have a recovery policy in place in case a successful attack occurs. Stay alert: Make sure all users know how to safely use the system. Stay motivated and keep your eyes peeled! Information security is the responsibility of all users. 1.4: Personal Security Password Attacks: Despite being the primary means of authentication for personal security, passwords are not strong defenses against attackers. 
                                    Users frequently choose weak passwords and use the same password multiple times. 
                                    With the help of AI, it is easier than ever before to crack poor passwords. Password Vulnerability: The most frequently used passwords are alarmingly simple: With easy-to-access AI hardware, those common passwords can be cracked almost instantly: Password cracking tools exist for anyone to explore: 2.1 Quiz

Navigating the Web: Exploring Internet Security and Beyond. Surface Web: The world wide web or surface web is the part of the internet that is easily accessible and searchable through standard search engines 
                                        like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. It's the web that most people interact with on a daily basis. The surface web itself is not vulnerable, but the vulnerability of individual websites or online platforms depends on certain factors, 
                                        including their security measures, updates, and how well they protect against potential threats. On the defensive side, cybersecurity pros use tools to check the WWW for signs of trouble, like leaked passwords or discussions about 
                                        cyber attacks. This helps them track down and be on top of problems before they become serious. Attackers also use the WWW to share hacking tools, plan attacks, and exchange information. This means security teams must always be 
                                        alert and ready to adapt to new methods coming from attackers. The Deep Web: The deep web refers to the portion of the internet that isn't indexed by traditional search engines like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. 
                                        It's comprised of websites that are not accessible through standard web browsers and often require specific software, configurations, 
                                        or permissions to access. This part of the internet includes paywalls, databases, password-protected sites, and other content that isn't meant for 
                                        public consumption. Now, the deep web itself isn't inherently criminal. It includes things like academic databases, private company intranets, and other 
                                        legitimate platforms that aren't designed to be indexed by search engines. However, it also harbors elements of the internet that are 
                                        used for illegal activities, which is where the term "dark web" often comes into play. In terms of criminal justice, the deep web is pertinent for a few reasons: Hidden Information: Criminals may use the deep web to hide information, such as their identities, communication, and 
                                                illicit transactions. This hidden nature poses challenges for law enforcement agencies trying to track criminal activities 
                                                and gather evidence. Investigative Leads: Despite being hidden, the deep web can provide valuable leads for criminal investigations. Law 
                                                enforcement agencies can use specialized tools and techniques to access certain parts of the deep web, uncovering information 
                                                crucial to solving cases. Cybercrime Infrastructure: Elements of cybercrime, such as botnets, malware distribution networks, and hacking forums, may operate 
                                                within the deep web. Understanding and infiltrating these networks are essential for combating cyber threats and safeguarding digital infrastructure. The Dark Web: The dark web is a hidden portion of the internet that requires specific software, configurations, or permissions to access. Unlike the deep web, which 
                                        includes all unindexed content, the dark web specifically refers to websites and content that exist on overlay networks and can only be accessed with 
                                        specialized tools like Tor (The Onion Router) browser. Renowned for its notorious mask of anonymity, the Dark Web emerges as a focal point for underground transactions and illicit activities making it a hub of 
                                        criminal commerce. The inception of the Dark Web can be traced back to the strategic endeavors of the United States (US) Department of Defense, which 
                                        sought to establish a secret and secure communication channel for its intelligence operatives. Illegal Marketplaces Anonumity and Encryption Cybercrime Extremism and Illegal Content 3.1 Internet Security Risks 3.1.1 User Device Threats Browser Dangers Email Risks 3.1.2 Threats From Web Servers Malvertising The random ads seen on popular websites are outsourced by the owner and not always monitored for malware that 
                                        is in disguise. Drive-By Downloads Viewing a website that is already infected with malware will infect your computer. The attacker is exploiting 
                                            the websites vulnerability and injecting it with harmful malicious content. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) An attack using scripting that originates from one site to impact another on the users computer. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) An attacker takes advantage of an authentication token that a websites send to the user. This can then result 
                                            in the user doing the work on the attackers behalf. 3.1.3 Transmission Risks Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) In a MITM attack, a bad actor secretly gets in the middle of a conversation between two parties, 
                                        like a user and a website. They sneakily listen in on the conversation and can even change what's being said or done. 
                                        It's like someone eavesdropping on your phone call without you knowing, but in the digital world. These attacks can 
                                        happen on networks or even on your Wi-Fi connection, so it's important to be cautious, especially when sharing sensitive 
                                        information online. Types of MITM Attacks Wi-Fi Eavesdropping Session Hijacking Man-in-the-Browser Email Hijacking ARP Cache Poisoning Session Replay 3.1.4 Common Internet Threats Malware Phishing Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial data 
                                            by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication. Cyber Attacks Online Scams Identity Theft - A type of cybercrime in which an individual's personal information is stolen and used by someone else for fraudulent 
                                                purposes. This stolen information can include Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, 
                                                bank account details, and other sensitive data. Fake Websites - Security Headers is a website that allows you to test and analyze the HTTP security headers of any website. 
                                            You can enter a website's URL, and the tool will provide a report on the security headers it uses and 
                                            recommendations for improvement. It's entirely web-based and doesn't require any downloads. Analyze Your URL Fraudulent Online Transactions - Fraudulent online transactions occur when someone makes unauthorized purchases or conducts deceptive activities using 
                                            another person's financial information, such as credit card numbers or bank account details. These transactions can 
                                            lead to financial losses, identity theft, and other adverse consequences for victims. 3.2 Internet Defenses 3.2.1 Securing the Web Browser 3.2.1.1 Security-Related Indicators Security-related indicators in terms of internet security refer to various signs or signals that can indicate 
                                        potential security threats, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activities. These indicators are often monitored by 
                                        security professionals, automated systems, or users themselves to detect and respond to security incidents effectively. Indicators: Unauthorized Access Attempts Changes in System Configurations Suspicious File or Network Activity Certificate Revocation Security Alerts from Intrusion Detection Systems/ Intrusion Prevention Systems 3.2.1.2 Web Browser Security Settings Web browser security settings refer to the configurable options and features within a web browser that help users 
                                        protect themselves against various online threats and enhance their overall internet security. These settings are 
                                        designed to mitigate risks such as malware infections, phishing attacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access to 
                                        sensitive information. 3.2.1.3 Managing Browser Extensions Managing browser extensions refers to controlling and overseeing the various add-ons, plugins, or extensions installed 
                                        in your web browser. These extensions can provide additional functionality, such as ad blocking, password management,
                                        or productivity tools. However, they can also pose security risks if not managed properly. 3.2.1.4 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) A VPN functions as a fortified conduit, establishing a secure connection between your device and the internet. In 
                                        this secure tunnel, your web traffic is rendered invisible to the prying eyes of hackers, shielding it from any 
                                        interception attempts. When you access the internet, your web traffic embarks on a journey that begins with its transmission to the Internet 
                                        Service Provider (ISP). En route, the traffic takes a detour through the VPN client software, where encryption wraps 
                                        your data in a protective cloak. This encrypted data then travels a secure tunnel, a virtual passageway safeguarded 
                                        against unauthorized access, until it reaches the VPN server. At this point, a transformation occurs where your 
                                        device's IP address and true location undergo a covert change, obscuring your digital footprint. The encrypted 
                                        message continues its journey through the secure tunnel until it reaches its final destination. It is at this 
                                        point that the encrypted layers are decrypted, revealing the original web traffic. This thorough process ensures 
                                        that your online activities remain concealed and secure, sealed from the probing eyes of potential cyber adversaries. 3.2.2 Email Defenses Attachments: Attachments are considered risky because they can be used as effective vectors for delivering malware, conducting 
                                        phishing attacks, exploiting software vulnerabilities, leaking sensitive data, and manipulating users through social 
                                        engineering tactics. To mitigate these risks, organizations must implement robust email security measures, educate 
                                        users about the dangers of email attachments, and employ best practices for handling and verifying attachments before 
                                        opening them. Phishing Quiz Spam Filters: Spam filters are like gatekeepers for your email inbox. They're software tools that help keep out unwanted or harmful 
                                        emails, like spam. They work by looking at things like who sent the email, what's in the email, and whether it looks suspicious. Email Security Settings: Email security settings are configurations and features that help protect your email account from various threats, such as unauthorized 
                                        access, phishing attacks, malware, and spam. These settings are essential for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring the 
                                        integrity and confidentiality of your email communications. Here are some common email security settings: Strong Passwords Two-Factor Authentication Account Recovery Options Email Encryption Spam Filtering Attachment Scanning Email Forwarding and Filtering Safe Browsing and Lin Protection Device Management Security Alerts and Notifications 3.3 Cybercrime and Law Enforcement 3.3.1 Digital Evidence Collection from Law Enforcement Agencies Digital evidence collection is an integral component of internet security, enabling organizations and law enforcement 
                                    agencies to investigate cybercrimes, respond to security incidents, identify threats, protect against future attacks,

                                        Constant vigilance and innovative responses are crucial to stay ahead of evolving threats. Interactive graph of the largest data breaches from the past decade. Unique Challenges for Criminal Justice Professionals: Universal Connectivity: Attackers can strike from anywhere, making containment challenging. Rapid Technological Evolution: Millions of computers can be harnessed quickly to launch coordinated attacks. Improving Attack Tools: Novices can access advanced malware tools for launching cyberattacks. Overwhelmed Vendors: Companies struggle to keep up with security updates. User Confusion: Inadequate understanding of security measures leaves users vulnerable. Why are Computer Security, Internet Security, and Privacy Important? Computer Security Computer security is necessary to protect computer systems and their data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. Key benefits include: Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle highly sensitive data such as personal information, investigation details, and national security data. 
                                        Effective protection is vital to prevent identity theft, compromised investigations, or data misuse. Maintaining Public Trust: Trust in the criminal justice system hinges on protecting sensitive data. 
                                        Strong security measures ensure public confidence. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Understanding cybersecurity helps during the investigation of cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking, leading to more effective prevention and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Agencies must comply with data protection and privacy regulations. 
                                        Failure to do so leads to legal issues and reputational damage. Internet Security Internet security is critical for criminal justice professionals due to the high risk of cybercriminals exploiting online vulnerabilities. Key considerations include: Network Shared Directories: Shared directories are commonly used within criminal justice systems. 
                                            Unauthorized access can compromise investigations and sensitive data. Cloud Storage: Cloud storage makes data easily accessible but also vulnerable. 
                                            Any data stored there could be compromised, leading to significant breaches. Privacy Criminal justice professionals must ensure that privacy and data management practices safeguard sensitive information. Backup Strategies: Effective backups provide an essential safety net for restoring sensitive data after breaches. 
                                            If compromised data can't be restored, investigations could be at risk. Disconnect and Isolate Devices: Isolating devices is critical for ensuring that sensitive data remains private. 
                                            Without physical disconnection, attackers could access data indirectly via connected storage. 1.1 What is Information Security? Just as we protect our homes against burglars with a security system, we also protect our personal information against threats (such as identity theft!). 
                                    Information security is the practice of protecting information with value for people and organizations. 
                                    As data is transmitted, processed and stored, it must be protected. Information security consists of three layers: Products, People and Policy Products: From door locks to sophisticated firewalls, physical products protect information. People: The folks who implement and properly use security products. Policy: Established by organizations so people correctly use security products. 1.2: Terminology Terminology: Here is a quick rundown of basic cybersecurity jargon. 
                                    We will use these terms to discuss attacks and defenses. Threat: action that could cause harm. Asset: item with value (information in our case!). Vulnerability: weakness in security. Risk: exposure to danger. Threat agent: person who could carry out the threat. Attack vector: how the attack could occur. Risks: Risks have their own associated vocabulary. Risk avoidance: avoid the risk in the first place, such as not storing information that could be stolen. Risk acceptance: accept there's a risk and do nothing. Risk deterrence: deter threat actors by advertising measures such as warnings and legal actions. Risk mitigation: make the risk less serious, such as by storing information in separate locations. Risk transference: hand the risk to someone else, such as by buying insurance. 1.3: Attacks and Defenses Attacks and attackers come in many forms: Attackers: Cybercriminals: seek fortune, not fame. Script kiddies: in it for thrills and notoriety. Brokers: sell vulnerabilities to highest bidder. Insiders: retaliate against own organization. Cyberterrorists: seek to cause pani. Hacktivists: think they are righting wrongs. State attackers: spy on and disrupt governments and citizens. Attacks: Point-of-sale (POS) attacks, where “memory scrapers” steal card information at time of transaction. Keyless entry system attacks, where threat actors amplify the signal of remote keys inside homes and gain access to vehicles parked outside. Home wireless network attacks, launching malicious software on home networks through a vulnerability found in 90 major manufacturers' products. Healthcare breaches are a huge problem and have even shut down hospitals entirely. Defenses: Block attacks: A strong security perimeter will protect you. Firewalls, VPNs, strong passwords, and even simple locks on doors can keep your information safer. Update defenses: Always keep hardware and software updated and install operating system security updates as soon as possible to protect against known threats. Minimize losses: Keep backup copies of data and have a recovery policy in place in case a successful attack occurs. Stay alert: Make sure all users know how to safely use the system. Stay motivated and keep your eyes peeled! Information security is the responsibility of all users. 1.4: Personal Security Password Attacks: Despite being the primary means of authentication for personal security, passwords are not strong defenses against attackers. 
                                    Users frequently choose weak passwords and use the same password multiple times. 
                                    With the help of AI, it is easier than ever before to crack poor passwords. Password Vulnerability: The most frequently used passwords are alarmingly simple: With easy-to-access AI hardware, those common passwords can be cracked almost instantly: Password cracking tools exist for anyone to explore: CIA: The Three Protections Confidentiality Confidentiality Only authorized parties should be able to view the information (example: credit card information). Integrity Integrity Information should be free from tampering (example: amount of purchase). Availability Availability The right people need to be able to access data as needed (example: security not so complex that merchant can’t access order information). AAA: Three Considerations Authentication Authentication Ensures user is not an impostor (example: 2FA to log on) Authorization Authorization Permission to use technology resources (example: clerk allowed to see order history for customer) Accounting Accounting Tracks events (example: who accessed server when)

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice What is Computer Security? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                            This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                            and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information. Enhancing Investigative Capabilities: Knowledge of computer security can enhance your ability to investigate cybercrimes like hacking, identity theft, and cyberstalking. 
                                        Insight into the methods used in these crimes facilitates more efficient measures for prevention, detection, and prosecution. Compliance with Legal Standards: Criminal justice agencies must comply with various legal standards and regulations regarding data protection and privacy. 
                                        Non-compliance can lead to legal ramifications and harm to the institution's reputation. 2.1 What is Malware? Malware is software that enters your computer system, without your knowledge, and carries out unwanted actions.
                                    Often, these actions damage, disrupt, or steal data on your computer; but they can even include planting a foothold for future access to your computer.
                                    If we think of your computer as a fortress, holding and protecting all of your valuable goods and information, then we can view malware as any type of non-human invader 
                                    that is trying to control access to those valuables. As there are many types of malware, it can be difficult to categorize them. 
                                    So, a common practice is to categorize them based on their primary action.
                                    These can be broken down into: Kidnap Data Eavesdrop Masquerade Serve as Launchpad Sidestep External Resource Link: Cybersecurity & infrastructure Security Agency Malware Tip Card Malware Primary Actions Kidnap Data: This type of malware specifically targets and restricts access to critical data, systems, or devices. 
                                    The predominant form, ransomware, encrypts essential files and systems, demanding payment for decryption keys. 
                                    Such attacks can cripple the operational capabilities of law enforcement departments, courts, corrections facilities, and legal firms, 
                                    resulting in substantial operational disruptions and significant financial losses. Eavesdrop: Eavesdropping malware captures and transmits user data without consent. 
                                    Examples include keyloggers that record keystrokes, spyware that monitors user activities, and other software that can access device cameras and microphones. 
                                    These tools are used for stealing sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and personal identification information. Masquerade: This category includes malware that impersonates legitimate software, deceiving users into installing it under false pretenses. 
                                    Once operational, it executes malicious activities that can compromise legal investigations and sensitive data. 
                                    Specifically, criminal justice professionals should be wary of Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) and Trojans. 
                                    These often come bundled with legitimate software or misrepresent their functionality, posing significant risks to the integrity of criminal justice systems and operations. Serve as Launchpad: Launchpad malware hijacks infected devices to initiate additional cyberattacks. 
                                    This includes viruses and worms that autonomously replicate and circulate across multiple systems, as well as bots that integrate into botnets. 
                                    These botnets are orchestrated to execute coordinated large-scale assaults such as DDoS attacks and spam campaigns, 
                                    which can severely compromise public safety and justice processes. Sidestep Security: This type of malware is strategically crafted to circumvent or neutralize security protocols. 
                                    Techniques include deploying rootkits to obscure the presence of malicious software, implementing backdoors to gain unauthorized access, 
                                    and programming logic bombs that execute harmful functions under specific conditions. 
                                    Such tactics pose significant threats to the integrity of criminal justice data and the secure operation of related information systems. 2.1.1 Data Kidnapping Data kidnapping mostly consists of Ransomware and Cryptomalware: Ransomware: Ransomware is a type of malicious software that prevents users from accessing their computer by locking the system. 
                                    It often demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. 
                                    Variants of ransomware may display deceitful messages claiming to be from law enforcement or software vendors, 
                                    alleging illegal activities or expired licenses to justify the lockdown. 
                                    This tactic can be particularly confusing and alarming for professionals in criminal justice, as it mimics legitimate legal authorities. 
                                    The ransomware may skip pretenses and straightforwardly demand payment to unlock the device. 
                                    Robust backup solutions and anti-malware systems are crucial for law enforcement agencies to mitigate the risk of such attacks. Cryptomalware: As a more severe form of ransomware, Cryptomalware encrypts all accessible files, rendering them inaccessible without a decryption key. 
                                    It may threaten to increase the ransom amount with each passing hour or day, adding urgency to its demands. 
                                    Newer variants are capable of spreading across network-connected devices, potentially crippling entire criminal justice systems. 
                                    Learning to recognize and avoid phishing attempts, which often distribute cryptomalware, is essential for protecting sensitive data and operational integrity. 2.1.2 Eavesdropping Eavesdropping mostly consists of Keyloggers and Spyware: Keyloggers: Keyloggers are tools that capture and store every keystroke made on a computer. 
                                    They can capture sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal identifiable information (PII), 
                                    posing a significant threat to privacy and security. Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based. 
                                    Software-based keyloggers are capable of taking screenshots and activating web cameras to capture images of the user.  
                                    They do not require physical access to be installed and can transmit captured data through the network. 
                                    Conversely, hardware-based keyloggers are usually small USB devices that are connected between a keyboard and computer, 
                                    typically in public locations where they are easier to install and retrieve later. 
                                    As they are external to the computer's operating system, they cannot be detected by standard antimalware software. Spyware: Spyware is malicious software that gathers information from a user's computer without their knowledge and sends it to third parties. 
                                    It can come in the form of automatic download software that self-installs without user interaction, potentially resulting in the installation of unauthorized software.
                                    Other forms include passive tracking technologies that collect data on user activities, system modifying software that changes user settings without permission, 
                                    and tracking software that monitors user behavior and collects data such as PII, increasing the risk of fraud and identity theft. 
                                    These aspects make spyware particularly dangerous for professionals in the criminal justice field, 
                                    where confidentiality and integrity of information are of the utmost importance. 2.1.3 Masquerading Masquerading mostly consists of Potentially Unwanted Programs, Trojans, and Remote Access Trojans (RATs): Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs): PUPs are applications that may be unwanted, despite often being bundled with software that users download and install. 
                                    Known for being hard to uninstall, these programs can slow down systems, display intrusive ads, and modify browser settings without clear approval. 
                                    They are frequently bundled as bloatware on new devices or installed unwittingly by users through default installation settings. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, such programs can undermine operational efficiency and compromise security protocols. Trojans: Trojans masquerade as legitimate and useful software but perform malicious activities in the background. 
                                    They might come in the form of a seemingly harmless scheduling software that, once installed, 
                                    can secretly scan the system and transmit sensitive data like passwords and case files to unauthorized parties. 
                                    This capability makes Trojans particularly dangerous, as they can lead to breaches of confidential and critical information. Remote Access Trojans (RATs): RATs are a type of Trojan that provide an attacker with remote control of the infected computer. 
                                    They are more invasive than basic Trojans, allowing attackers to engage directly with the system's files, 
                                    observe user behavior via keylogging or webcam access, and execute arbitrary commands. 
                                    This type of malware poses a severe risk to law enforcement agencies and other criminal justice entities by 
                                    potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive operations and data. 2.1.4 Serving as a Launchpad Serving as a Launchpad mostly consists of Viruses, Worms, and Bots: Viruses: A virus is malicious software that attaches to another program or file, enabling it to spread from one computer to another and leave infections as it travels. 
                                    Almost any program or file type can be a target for viruses. 
                                    They are capable of deleting or corrupting files, stealing data, hijacking core computing functions, and spreading across networks. 
                                    However, before a virus can spread and infect other files, it must be interacted with, as is the case when opening an infected file or downloading from unsecured websites. 
                                    This increases the chance of criminal justice professionals encountering viruses due to the investigative nature of their work. Worms: Unlike viruses, worms are self-replicating and do not require a host program or human interaction to spread. 
                                    They exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems or other software to spread across networks and can carry payloads designed to steal data, 
                                    install backdoors, or cause damage to systems they infect. 
                                    Their ability to spread rapidly can lead to significant disruptions in services, including the overload of web servers and the breach of sensitive information. Bots: Bots are software applications that run automated tasks over the internet. 
                                    They can create networks called botnets, which can be used by threat actors to perform large-scale malicious activities such as sending spam, 
                                    spreading malware, or executing DDoS attacks. 
                                    Bot herders control these botnets by issuing commands from a remote location, often masking their activities through third-party servers to evade detection. 
                                    Criminal justice systems need robust cybersecurity measures to detect and respond to botnet activities, 
                                    which often target and exploit both public and private sector resources. 2.1.5 Sidestepping Sidestepping mostly consists of Backdoors, Logic Bombs, and Rootkits: Backdoors: Backdoors are used of bypass normal authentication procedures, thus allowing remote access to a device without the user's knowledge. 
                                    In the criminal justice field, such vulnerabilities could be exploited to access confidential data, including case files and personal information. 
                                    Initially, developers may create backdoors for legitimate purposes such as maintenance. 
                                    However, if not removed, they pose a significant security risk as they can be discovered and used maliciously. Logic Bombs: Logic bombs are pieces of code that have been inserted into software and are designed to execute under specific conditions, 
                                    such as a specific time or when a certain action is performed. 
                                    For example, a logic bomb could be set to execute its attack three months after an employee left the firm, or after the 45th email sent by a clerk.
                                    A logic bomb could potentially be used to destroy data, disrupt system operations, or corrupt essential legal documents. 
                                    These are often hard to detect and can be planted by insiders who are trusted with access to sensitive systems. Rootkits: Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware in a system by intercepting and altering standard operating system processes. 
                                    Deeply embedded within the operating system, they are extremely difficult to detect and can give attackers full control of the system without the user's knowledge. 
                                    For criminal justice systems, rootkits represent a serious threat as they can be used to manipulate operations, 
                                    alter data, or steal information without detection for long periods. 2.2 Defending Against Malware As criminal justice professionals, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of your computer systems is paramount.

                                    These security programs scan, detect, and remove threats by monitoring system activity and checking files against databases of known malware signatures. 
                                    They also employ heuristic and behavior-based detection methods to identify unknown malware based on suspicious behavior. 
                                    Additionally, these tools provide real-time protection by blocking potentially harmful programs and files before they can cause damage, 
                                    ensuring that digital environments remain secure and operational. Antivirus Software Antivirus software is designed to: Scan and Monitor: It continuously scans the computer and monitors activities to identify potential threats. Examine Files: New documents are inspected when they are opened, created, or closed to detect any signs of infection Virus Detection: Uses a scanning engine and a database of known virus signatures to detect infections. 
                                        Keeping the signature file updated is crucial as outdated signatures can lead to security breaches. Response Actions: Upon detecting a virus, the software can remove the virus, quarantine the infected file, or delete the file outright. Limitations: While antivirus software provides a valid means of security, it should not be seen as a comprehensive solution to all security threats. Comprehensive Antimalware Software Beyond basic antivirus functions, comprehensive antimalware includes: Intrusion Prevention: Analyzes incoming data from the network, actively blocking potential threats before they enter the computer. Reputation Protection: Classifies software and files as “dangerous,” “risky,” or “safe” based on information gathered from a global network, enhancing proactive security measures. Behavioral Protection: Watches for unusual behavior in software and automatically intervenes to block potentially malicious activities. Built-in Antimalware Both Windows and MacOS provide built-in antimalware solutions: Windows: Microsoft Defender Antivirus offers integrated security right out of the box. MacOS Apple XProtect provides a basic level of protection against malware. Compatibility Warning: When considering third-party antimalware software, it's important to ensure there are no conflicts between it and built-in systems. 
                                        Always verify compatibility to avoid potential security gaps or performance issues. 2.2.3 Firewalls Monitoring and managing firewalls is a vital component of a proper cybersecurity posture,

                                    Firewalls act as the first line of defense, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 
                                    This includes not only blocking unauthorized access but also managing data packets that might carry potential threats. 
                                    Effective firewall management involves regular updates and audits to ensure that all security protocols are up to date and functioning as intended. Personal Firewalls Function: Personal firewalls act as packet filters that control the traffic entering or exiting a personal computer. Application Firewalls: These These are typically pre-installed on modern operating systems and are designed to allow traffic through only for specific, approved programs. 
                                        This helps to prevent an infected computer from spreading malware to other machines. Traffic Control: By default, these firewalls block all inbound traffic unless it has been explicitly allowed, while generally permitting outbound traffic unless specifically blocked. Network Firewalls Hardware-Based: Network firewalls are usually hardware devices placed at the edge of a network. Scope: They are designed to protect the entire network by inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic to decide whether to deny or allow it. Location: Often integrated into the routers provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), they serve as the first line of defense for all devices connected to the network. Best Practices for Firewall Management Regular Inspections: Periodically check firewalls to ensure they are active and functioning as expected. 
                                        This includes verifying that no unauthorized changes have been made to the rules—a common target for malware designed to weaken network defenses. Dual Use: For enhanced security, it is best to use both application and network firewalls. 
                                        This layered approach helps to secure individual machines as well as the entire network, contributing to a defense-in-depth approach to cybersecurity. 2.2.4 Ransonmware Prevention Effectively preventing ransomware involves a strategic combination of disconnecting potential entry points and maintaining secure backups. Disconnect and Isolate Devices Disconnecting devices can significantly reduce the risk of ransomware infection. Local and Networked Devices: Any device with a drive letter (C:\, D:\, etc.) or networked storage that syncs automatically poses a risk if compromised. 
                                        Using air gaps, or physical separations, between computers and storage devices can be an effective deterrent. USB and External Drives: Physically unplugging USB storage devices and unmounting secondary hard drives when not in use can make them invisible to ransomware attacks. Network Shared Directories: Limiting access to these directories by requiring login credentials from specific user accounts adds an additional layer of security. Cloud Storage: Turning off automatic synchronization and requiring manual login for cloud services decreases the vulnerability of cloud-stored data. Backup Data Backups are essential for recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. Data Copies: Regularly updated backups should be stored in secure locations, isolated from the network. 
                                        This prevents ransomware from accessing both primary and backup data, allowing for recovery without paying the ransom. What is Computer Security? Computer security is an aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on the protection of computer systems and the data they store from unauthorized access, damage, or theft. 
                            This is critical not only for preserving the confidentiality, integrity, 
                            and availability of information but also for safeguarding the infrastructure that supports our legal and governmental institutions. Why is Computer Security Important in Criminal Justice? Protecting Sensitive Data: Criminal justice systems handle sensitive data, including personal information about citizens, details of ongoing investigations, and national security information. 
                                        Ensuring the security of this data helps to prevent negative consequences caused by unintentional oversight. Maintaining Public Trust: Effective computer security measures help maintain public confidence in the criminal justice system's ability to safeguard sensitive information.

Try creating other types of sensitive data to see if it can pick up on it as well. (Please note that you should not use real sensitive data). Try different output formats to see what ChatGPT can create.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Scenario 1: Data Loss and Misuse Objectives Define sensitive information based on a given set of parameters. Review a document and determine if sensitive information is present. Create output in a format that can be used by a monitoring system. Key Points Familiarize and interact with AI engine. Ability to define sensitive information. Ability to generate alerts to start an investigation. Easy of use and shallow learning curve. Overview Every information security group involved has maintained a relationship with law enforcement. This relationship fostered an exchange of ideas and perspectives that helped improve each other’s skill sets and thought processes. Our law enforcement contacts provided guidance and insight for features and functionality that would help monitor our environment and identify potential issues, plus aid in the gathering of evidence to support an investigation, if warranted. AI is a tremendous help with this collaborative process. It can be used to quickly and easily transform law enforcement insight into actionable processes and systems for an organization. It empowers end users with limited technical skill sets to generate queries that can aid in monitoring and research. It can also aid in the development process by reducing development times and accelerating the production of actionable information. This leads us to data management, which is a unique challenge for an organization. Data is needed for a company to function, so it cannot be locked down completely, but it still needs to be accessed, controlled, and monitored. The introduction of AI offers an opportunity to identify data and help monitor how it is used and stored within a company. Ideally, we would have a means to monitor data that traverses a network and resides on end user systems and file shares. We would like to identify data that is being mishandled or shared inappropriately. We would like to capture this data for review and possible reference and initiate an alert that would prompt action by the responsible party. The monitoring of enterprise resources and assets is where AI can help greatly. It offers the opportunity to build an algorithm that can identify data structures and perform initial checks of data. If a positive hit is made, the associative components can initiate a manual review, response, and evidence capture.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Scenario 2: Segregation of Duties Objectives Review an access control list (ACL). Analyze ACL entries and identify anomalies that may denote conflicts. Key Points AI ability to analyze user access and identify concerns. Familiarize and interact with AI engine. Ease of use and interactivity with a shallow learning curve. Ability to generate usable results quickly. Overview Segregation of duties (SOD) is an important concept in cybersecurity. It establishes boundaries and perimeters that limit access based on need-to-know and least privilege. This helps protect an organization from accidental or malicious acts, functioning like an invisible fence inside the organization that prevents individuals from having too much access. SOD is important to law enforcement as it relates to opportunity. It assists in identifying individuals who may have the means to act without mitigation or oversight controls. Conversely, it protects an organization from these same acts by forcing collusion for unauthorized actions to occur. AI can assist an organization in several ways. It can help develop SOD policies and processes and also aid in implementing these processes to ensure adherence and identification of possible gaps. Lastly, AI helps monitor SOD configurations and audit logs to identify actions that violate SOD policies and procedures. An example of how AI aids in reducing the risk of excessive access is the concept of access creep. An organization operates as a dynamic system, constantly changing day by day. Changes in an individual’s roles and responsibilities may lead to changes in their level of access. If their access isn't adjusted when their role changes or during periodic reviews, they can retain legacy access from their previous role, leading to access creep. The test database designed for this scenario examines access creep. An individual recently elevated to a supervisor role gains oversight responsibilities with approval access. However, their access for creation, modification, and deletion must be removed. In Laura Anderson's case, her ability to modify transactions has been maintained. This is where AI becomes helpful in identifying users with access that violates SOD policies. It can analyze the organization’s access control list, identify violations for remediation, and highlight areas that may require additional investigation if unauthorized actions have been taking place.

Cybersecurity for Criminal Justice Scenario 2: Segregation of Duties Applications of AI in Key Areas 1.

                                        Transactions that occur farther than 300 miles apart within a short time frame can be considered anomalies. Steps to Identify Anomalies: Identify Locations: Group transactions based on geographical proximity. Compare Dates and Locations: Check if transactions happen within a short time but involve distant locations (more than 300 miles apart). Key Locations: Daytona Beach, FL Sanford, FL Lake Mary, FL Valdosta, GA Columbus, GA Shenyang, China (definitely an outlier) Transactions Likely to Be Anomalies: August 15, 2024 – WaWa (Valdosta, GA 31601) → August 16, 2024 – WaWa (Columbus, GA 31906) These two locations (Valdosta and Columbus, GA) are more than 300 miles apart but occur within a day. This is suspicious. August 20, 2024 – WaWa (Valdosta, GA 31906) → August 21, 2024 – WaWa (Columbus, GA 31601) Similarly, Valdosta and Columbus (GA) transactions occur within a day, which seems like an anomaly. August 30, 2024 – Pizza Hut (Shenyang, China 110000) → Transactions before and after this date happen in Florida and Georgia, making this transaction a significant anomaly,
                                        as China is much farther than 300 miles from these locations. Summary of Anomalies: August 15, 2024 – Valdosta, GA August 16, 2024 – Columbus, GA August 20, 2024 – Valdosta, GA August 21, 2024 – Columbus, GA August 30, 2024 – Shenyang, China These transactions are flagged as anomalies based on distance. Would you like a more detailed breakdown or additional analysis? The modified query was entered into ChatGPT: Can you reanalyze this data and factor out transactions that occur in close time proximity and can be reached within a day’s drive? ChatGPT response: Let's reanalyze the data while factoring out transactions that can be reasonably reached within a day's drive, which typically would include locations within approximately 300-400 miles. Locations Breakdown: Daytona Beach, FL (32114) Sanford, FL (32773) Lake Mary, FL (32746) Valdosta, GA (31601) – About 200 miles from Daytona Beach, within a day's drive. Columbus, GA (31906) – About 300 miles from Valdosta, GA; could also be within a day's drive from Daytona Beach, FL. Shenyang, China (110000) – Clearly outside the scope of a day's drive from any of the U.S. locations. Analysis: 1. August 15, 2024 – WaWa (Valdosta, GA 31601) → August 16, 2024 – WaWa (Columbus, GA 31906) These two transactions are within a day's drive (approx. 3-4 hours apart). These could be regular transactions and are not anomalies. 2. August 20, 2024 – WaWa (Valdosta, GA 31601) → August 21, 2024 – WaWa (Columbus, GA 31906) Similar situation: these two locations are within driving distance. These are also not considered anomalies. 3. August 30, 2024 – Pizza Hut (Shenyang, China 110000) This is the standout anomaly, as travel to China from Florida or Georgia would take significantly more than a day's drive (or even a direct flight). No transactions around this date suggest that Michael Johnson could have traveled back to the U.S. on the same day. Therefore, this transaction is highly anomalous. Final List of Anomalies: After considering proximity and time, only one transaction stands out as a significant anomaly: August 30, 2024 – Pizza Hut (Shenyang, China 110000) Conclusion ChatGPT analyzed a list of transactions, providing a breakdown by activity and reasonableness. It factored in travel times and accounted for this in the analysis, even incorporating possible air travel as an option. As a result, it identified a transaction that was reasonable and recommended for review. This simple use case underscores the possibilities of ease of use and analysis. It demonstrates the power of AI to work with data and generate useful and insightful analysis that aids investigations. A query was generated in question form and run against a sample dataset. AI processed the supplied data and identified transactions based on location and activity context. ChatGPT modeled the distance between each location without user guidance and expanded its analysis to include air travel times. It also identified possible false positives and provided an analysis, all without requiring formal programming or database knowledge. AI offers law enforcement a tool that is easy to learn and delivers investigative results. The AI-generated analysis serves as a strong starting point for investigations, helping to identify suspicious activity while filtering out false positives based on user-supplied criteria. The response provides insightful, human-readable analysis, offering an excellent foundation for further investigation. Takeaways A query was generated in English and applied to the data set. No need arose to incorporate regular expressions, a programming language, or database skills. The AI engine quickly assembled a response with insightful analysis. The initial results were accurate but could be refined further. A secondary query was made to further refine the results.

Ease of use and interactivity. Shallow learning curve. Interactivity forgiveness. Ability to generate usable results quickly. Overview The ability to monitor and detect anomalous activity within a system is critical for an organization, an information security team, and law enforcement.  It is the first step in identifying activity that needs to be responded to by an organization and possibly escalated to law enforcement. The challenge to an organization is multifaceted.  An organization’s systems can and will generate a lot of data.  This data needs to be reviewed and analyzed for patterns that would denote an issue that needs to be investigated.  This poses two challenges.  The first is the volume of data.  The second is how to process and analyze this data. Developers can develop queries and use analytics software to help reduce the overhead of these tasks.  This approach is limited by the expertise of the developer and experience with behavioral activity that might denote maliciousness.  Law enforcement is a tremendous resource that has experience in analyzing and recognizing activity that is suspicious and should be investigated. This is where AI comes into play.  It provides an opportunity for law enforcement to put their expertise into use by analyzing data and recognizing patterns.  It provides an easy-to-use interface that can be interacted without knowledge of a programming language or software development skills.  AI empowers a law enforcement individual to upload data from a spreadsheet (or larger database) and provide guidance on what to look for.  Depending on the amount of data, the AI engine can identify patterns and provide insightful analysis.
